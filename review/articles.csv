In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education";" it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014-2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain."","""",10.1109/TLT.2023.3314610,Artificial intelligence Education Surveys Data mining Market research Systematics Recommender sys...";Keywords-Plus = LEARNING ANALYTICS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS BIG DATA SYSTEMS PREDICTION FRAMEWORK;Research-Areas = Computer Science Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Computer Science;Interdisciplinary Applications Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = kashif.ahmad@mtu.ie w.iqbal@qmul.ac.uk a.elhassan@psut.edu.jo jqadir@qu.edu.qa dbe...;Affiliations = University of London Queen Mary University London Princess Sumaya University for T...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, due to the increasing number of educational content, it becomes very difficult for learners to find the most appropriate items. Most previous methods focused on users' ratings to establish learner's profiles, while recent work has added users' comments. In this work we are interested on the usage of social learning networks and we propose a novel learning items recommendation approach through sentiment analysis. Two different deep neural network models (DNNs) have been used, namely: bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with their modified version, long short-term memory (LSTM). These models are based on the learners' data, including their favourite content and comments. To support learners in selecting learning resources, a list of trusted learners was developed using similarity between learners. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, experiments have been conducted on two different datasets. The results we have obtained demonstrated that our approach outperforms the baselines and related work."","""",10.1504/IJLT.2024.143969,social learning networks social recommender system trust sentiment analysis deep neural models BE...";Keywords-Plus = SYSTEMS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = y _aissaoui@esi.dz lberkani@usthb.dz f _azouaou@esi.dz;Affiliations = Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Informatique University Science & Technology Houari B...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The analysis of the semantic path of a learner or group of learners during the learning process can allow detecting those students who are in needs of help as well as identify the insufficiently mastered concepts. We examine the possibility of using a student's browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course's author to adapt the course to the learner's needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the student's browsing path. More precisely, we use a domain ontology of the course and the similarities that exist between external documents (visited pages) and the domain concepts (the course keywords).

This implies that e-commerce is facing the problem of data and information overloads. While customers are shopping via websites, they spend a lot of time to search for the required products based on their needs. This problem can easily be alleviated by having an accurate recommendation system based on a strong algorithm and confident measures in this regard. There are two main techniques for products recommendation"; content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. If one of these two techniques implemented on the e-commerce system, a lot of limitations and weak points will appear. This paper aims at generating an optimal list of product, which, in turn, generates an accurate and reliable list of items. The new approach is composed of three components;" clustering algorithm, user-based collaborative filtering, and the Cosine similarity measure.

This process is widely applied as a learning method to in-volve students in the progress of their learning. However, as students have dif-ferent ability levels, the efficacy of the peer feedback differs from case to case. Thus, peer assessment may not provide satisfactory results for students. In or-der to mitigate this issue, this paper explains and evaluates an algorithm that matches the author to a set of reviewers. The technique matches authors and re-viewers based on how difficult the authors perceived the assignment to be, and the algorithm then matches the selected author to a group of reviewers who may meet the author's needs in regard to the selected assignment.Methodology This study used the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making methodology (MCDM) to determine a set of reviewers from among the many available options. The weighted sum method was used because the data that have been collected in user profiles are expressed in the same unit. This study produced an experi-mental result, examining the algorithm with a real collected dataset and mock- up dataset. In total, there were 240 students in the real dataset, and it contained self-assessment scores, peer scores, and instructor scores for the same assign-ment. The mock-up dataset created 1000 records for self-assessment scores. The algorithm was evaluated using focus group discussions with 29 program-ming students and interviews with seven programming instructors. Contribution This paper contributes to the field in the following two ways. First, an algorithm using a MCDM methodology was proposed to match authors and reviewers in order to facilitate the peer assessment process. In addition, the algorithm used self-assessment as an initial data source to match users, rather than randomly creating reviewer - author pairs.Findings The findings show the accurate results of the algorithm in matching three re-viewers for each author. Furthermore, the algorithm was evaluated based on students' and instructors' perspectives. The results are very promising, as they depict a high level of satisfaction for the Balanced Allocation algorithm. Recommendations for PractitionersRecommendations for Researchers We recommend instructors to consider using the Balanced Allocation algorithm to match students in peer assessments, and consequently to benefit from per-sonalizing peer assessment based on students' needs. Several MCDM methods could be expanded upon, such as the analytic hierar-chy process (AHP) if different attributes are collected, or the artificial neural network (ANN) if fuzzy data is available in the user profile. Each method is suitable for special cases depending on the data available for decision-making.Impact on Society Suitable pairing in peer assessment would increase the credibility of the peer as-sessment process and encourage students' engagement in peer assessments.Future Research The Balanced Allocation algorithm could be applied using a single group, and a peer assessment with random matching with another group may also be con-ducted, followed by performing a t-test to determine the impact of matching on students' performances in the peer assessment activity."","""",10.28945/5038,peer assessment peer review matching peers adaptive peer assessment";Keywords-Plus = STUDENTS SELF METAANALYSIS PERCEPTIONS PERFORMANCE EDUCATION FEEDBACK IMPACT;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = akalkalifh@pnu.edu.sa marie.devlin@newcastle.ac.uk mkhattabi@imamu.edu.sa;Affiliations = Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Newcastle University - UK Imam Mohamma...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One of the most concerning issues for those fresh undergraduate college students is the selection of their specialization. College specialization selection is critical for them, as their academic and career future will be affected by this decision. An unsuitable specialization selection will have unfortunate consequences, not only on the students' future but also on the university's resources and budget. This paper suggests a solution to this problem by introducing a preliminary study of a recommender system (RS), which will recommend the appropriate specialization for the students based on various tests and grades during the preparatory year at King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The proposed system guides students through their specialization selection process based on their abilities. The collaborative filtering technique was used to build the RS and K-fold cross-validation was adopted to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The results showed the prediction of a specialization for each student with good accuracy ratio.

These attempts include the integration of GitHub into software engineering classes, the creation of learning management systems, gamification approaches, and collaborative learning platforms. These initiatives have demonstrated promise in boosting students' collaborative growth and cooperation abilities, emphasizing their potential influence on improving learning experiences in practical areas. Books, on the other hand, remain basic in education, but their physical size limits their ability to explore all practical elements of a topic in depth. This limitation requires more research and application of theoretical information in real-world circumstances. In this work, we address the issue of limited space in traditional books that frequently prevents complete presentation of practical elements of a topic. To address this issue, we propose an application that improves the reading experience and accelerates the learning process. To anticipate themes, we use a combination of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms and a generative pre-trained transformer. First, utilizing LDA to find potential topic keywords inside the text and then leveraging generative pretrained transformer to predict topic names based on the LDA produced keywords. In addition, a query builder module produces and executes queries depending on the current page's topic, obtaining real-world issues from Stack Overflow. The system classifies results by query-title similarity, question-answer ranking, and content quality before displaying them to users. This bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. We illustrate the usefulness of suggested tool using simulations, comparison with existing tools and user studies.

Although critical reading, which is the main medium for accessing the right knowledge, is defined as a sub-category for creative reading in which high cognitive processes are involved, the connection between these has not been clearly put forward. This study aimed at examining the effect of critical reading skills of 5th grade learners on their evaluation skills of creative reading process, and the role of gender in this effect through structural equation modelling. Research Methods: The study was supported by relational screening model. The study group was formed by simple random sampling and composed of 265 5th grade learners. The data were collected through the Scale for the Evaluation of Creative Reading Process and the Critical Reading Scale. SPSS 23, AMOS 22.0, and structural equation modeling were utilized for data analysis. Maximum Likelihood method was selected in the estimation of parameters related to models which were formed for examining the effect of critical reading skills on the evaluation of creative reading process and the role of gender. To this end, fit indices (chi(2)/df, CFI, GFI, TLI, NFI, IFI, RMSEA, and SRMR) were used. Findings: The study demonstrated that all hypotheses models were valid";" critical reading skills explained the evaluation skills of creative reading process by 57\%, and that they had a direct and strong impact on the evaluation skills of the critical reading process. In the female-learner model, critical reading skills affected the evaluation skills by 43\%, whereas the male-learner model explained this effect by 67\%. In addition, both models bear a direct and strong impact. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of the study reveal that critical reading skill is a significant predictor for the evaluation of the creative reading process. It can be stated that the evaluation skills of the creative reading process may improve in conjunction with the development of critical reading skills. (C) 2020 Ani Publishing Ltd.

Methodology: We ran a three-year classroom experiment where we collected data from 1) interactions with the online concept map system and 2) their perceptions of the concept maps' usefulness and understandability. Regarding the experiment design, during lectures, the instructor used concept maps to highlight course concepts and their relationships. In the independent practice context, interactive concept maps helped students choose relevant practice content to work on and served as an OLM to visualize individual-and class-level progress in mastering course concepts Findings: We found that having access to concept maps that present a holistic view of course concepts in both study contexts improved students' ability to answer questions that required the application of conceptual knowledge. We also found that the use of the concept map system was correlated with an increase in students' positive perceptions of the usefulness of the intervention, both at a lecture level and at a practice level, but also with their actual engagement with working with the educational content offered by the learning platform."","""",""10.1109/TE.2025.3593411 , EarlyAccessDate = AUG 2025"",Reviews Surveys Telecommunications Navigation Peer-to-peer computing Monitoring Distance measurem...";Keywords-Plus = NAVIGATION SUPPORT KNOWLEDGE DESIGN;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research Engineering;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education;Scientific Disciplines Engineering;Electrical & Electronic;Author-Email = jab464@pitt.edu menon@pennwest.edu jguerra@inf.uach.cl peterb@pitt.edu;Affiliations = Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE) University of Pittsbu...,,;;;;;;;;;;;

A limitation of ITSs is that few contents are compatible with this approach. On the other hand, recommendation systems can recommend different types of content but ignore the fine-grained concepts typical of the step-by-step approach. This work contributes to the solution of this state-of-the-art challenge by proposing an approach for the recommendation of learning objects from different areas of knowledge, considering the refined concepts of ITSs. To deal with this challenge, we formulate the learning object recommendation problem as the set covering problem that belongs to the NP-hard class problems. An exact algorithm and a greedy heuristic were properly adapted, resulting in a promising approach to solve these problems, as shown by the results. This resulted in more personalised content for students using collaborative filtering and an ontology that models their knowledge, learning styles and search parameters."","""",10.1504/IJLT.2024.137898,learning objects recommendation personalised recommendation collaborative filtering ontology set ...";Keywords-Plus = OPTIMIZATION SYSTEMS STYLES;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = clarivando@ufu.br fabianodor@ufu.br lpassis@ufvjm.edu.br alessandrovivas@ufvjm.edu.br;Affiliations = Universidade Federal dos Vales do Jequitinhonha e Mucuri (UFVJM);Funding-Acknowledgement = Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil...;Funding-Text = This study was financed in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher ...;and it was supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq G...;Number-of-Cited-References = 43;Times-Cited = 0;Usage-Count-Last-180-days = 0;Usage-Count-Since-2013 = 4;Journal-ISO = Int.

Besides, the MOOC has tools that allow learners to seek information, express their ideas, and participate in discussions in an online forum. This tool is a huge repository of rich data, which continues to evolve, however its exploitation is fiddly in the search for information relevant to the learner. Similarly, the task of the tutor seems to be difficult in management of a large number of learners. To this end, the development of a Chatbot able to meet the requests of learners in a natural language is necessary to the deroulement a course in the MOOC. The ChatBot plays the role of assistant and guide for the learners and for the tutors. However, ChatBot responses come from a knowledge base, which must be relevant. Knowledge extraction to answer questions is a difficult task due to the number of MOOC participants. Learners' interactions with the MOOC platform generate massive information, particularly in discussion forums by seeking answers to their questions. Identifying and extracting knowledge from online forums requires collaborative interactions between learners. In this article we propose a new approach to answer learners' questions in a relevant and instantaneous way in a ChatBot in natural language. Our model is based on the LDA Bayesian statistical method, applied to threads posted in the forum and classifies them to provide the learner with a rich semantic response. These threads taken from the discussion forum in the form of knowledge will enrich the ChatBot knowledge database. In parallel, we will map the extracted knowledge to ontology, to provide the learner with pedagogical resources that will serve as learning support."","""",10.3991/ijet.v15i20.15657,Mooc ChatBot Forum Discussion Latent Dirichlet Allocation Knowledge extraction ontology";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = yassine.benjelloune.touimi@gmail.com;Affiliations = Mohammed V University in Rabat,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, recommender systems still have not found major usage in K12 education. This may be because of the unique challenges that recommender systems face when used by a young and diverse population. However, recommender systems for K12 education could provide many benefits for students and teachers, such as the simplification of personalized learning. Some of the issues with K12 educational recommender systems may be solved by the use of deep learning and implicit feedback. As such, we investigated the use of deep recommendation algorithms and implicit feedback for K12 educational recommender systems. To do this, we compared metrics for highly cited traditional and deep recommendation algorithms trained on explicit and implicit data. We found that recommendation algorithms using deep learning as a group do not differ in performance compared to traditional recommendation algorithms. We also found that the use of implicit feedback led to higher performance than using explicit feedback. The best performing algorithm used both deep learning and implicit feedback. We conclude that deep learning can be a benefit for K12 recommender systems, particularly when the ordered sequence of items is carefully accounted for.

Each of the considered user, learner and player sub-models has a static and dynamic group of characteristics. These characteristics assist general approaches for learning mazes game personalization applied to embedded mini-games (designed as information units, learning objects and educational tasks) so that to be adjustable and to enable learners to acquire knowledge more effectively. Design/methodology/approach A student modelling approach was applied to design the personalization of learning content in the educational maze game and each of them contained mini-games. To evaluate the student's preferences about the types of mini-games and ways of their personalization depending on individual and group student characteristics, the authors conducted an online survey. Findings This study presents examples of personalization of four types of mini-games available in maze halls, namely, question, searching, arranging and action games. Next, the research discusses findings from an online survey aiming at the evaluation of the preferred types of mini-games and the way of their personalization. There are analysed results concerning the impact of the student model characteristics on the preferred ways of personalization in educational maze games, together with criteria for personalization of educational resources according to student's level of knowledge, age, goals and learning style. Research limitations/implications A significant limitation of the research is the relatively small number of survey participants and the lack of studying the impact of learning and playing styles over game personalization. Another limitation of the study is the inclusion of only some of the mini-games within the demonstration maze, which respondents play before answering the survey questions.

"rayyan-358097774,An Intelligent Recommender System for Personalized Test Administration Scheduling With Computerized Formative Assessments,2020,,,Frontiers in Education,,5,,,""Bulut, Okan and Cormier, Damien C. and Shin, Jinnie"",,,,,""The introduction of computerized formative assessments in schools has enabled the monitoring of students' progress with more flexible test schedules. Currently, the timing and frequency of computerized formative assessments are determined based on districts and school authorities' agreements with testing organizations, the teachers' judgment of students' progress, and grade-level testing guidelines recommended by researchers. However, these practices often result in a rigid test scheduling that disregards the pace at which students acquire knowledge. Furthermore, students are likely to experience the loss of instructional time due to frequent testing. To administer computerized formative assessments efficiently, teachers should be provided systematic guidance on finding an optimal testing schedule based on each student's progress. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the utility of intelligent recommender systems (IRSs) for generating individualized test schedules for students. Using real data from a large sample of students in grade 2 (n = 355,078) and grade 4 (n = 390,336) who completed the Star Math assessment during the 2017-2018 school year, we developed an IRS and evaluated its performance in finding a balance between data quality and testing frequency. Results indicated that the IRS was able to recommend a fewer number of test administrations for both grade levels, compared with standard practice. Further, the IRS was able to maximize the score difference from one test administration to another by eliminating the test administrations in which students' scores did not change significantly. Implications for generating personalized schedules to monitor student progress and recommendations for future research are discussed."","""",""10.3389/feduc.2020.572612 , Article-Number = 572612 , EISSN = 2504-284X"",recommender system formative assessment personalized learning progress monitoring mathematics";Keywords-Plus = CURRICULUM-BASED MEASUREMENT PROGRESS STUDENTS FREQUENCY EDUCATION FEEDBACK IMPACT;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = bulut@ualberta.ca;Affiliations = University of Alberta University of Alberta,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, classical recommender systems usually suffer from item cold-start issues. Besides, unlike other fields like e-commerce or entertainment, e-learning recommendations must ensure that learners have the adequate background knowledge to cognitively receive the recommended learning objects. For that reason, when designing an efficient e-learning recommendation method, these challenges should be considered. To address those issues, in this paper, we first propose extracting pairs concept prerequisites using Linked Open Data (LOD). Then, we evaluate the proposed list of prerequisite relationships using machine learning predictive models. Then, we present the recommendation approach based on matching concept's prerequisites relation and courses metadata through a similarity score. The experimental result of prerequisite identification was evaluated using four well-known machine learning algorithms while achieving an accuracy of 90\%. Moreover, using three known evaluation metrics, the final prerequisite-based recommendation demonstrates very good results (NDCG@10 = 86\%). This solution will enhance recommendations on online learning platforms. Additionally, it will overcome the cold-start issue and accomplish the needed prerequisites and background knowledge for learners to attain their learning objectives."","""",""10.1186/s40561-024-00301-0 , Article-Number = 16 , EISSN = 2196-7091"",Content-based recommendation Course metadata Prerequisites identification Machine learning Cold-s...";Keywords-Plus = SYSTEMS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = abdessamad.chanaa@gmail.com;Affiliations = Mohammed V University in Rabat,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study applied an educational data mining approach, including clustering and classification, to analyze students' problem-solving and help-seeking data in a computer assisted learning system to identify student help-seeking behavior patterns and tendencies. First, nine observable problem-solving and help-seeking features for identifying help-seeking behavior patterns were established. Second, this study applied the k-means clustering method and identified three well-known help-seeking behavior patterns: executive, avoidant, and instrumental help-seeking. The results further identified two new help-seeking behavior patterns. One was static instrumental help-seeking and the other was static instrumental and executive help-seeking. Third, executive help-seeking and static instrumental and executive help-seeking patterns could be used as at-risk predicators of poor performance. Fourth, the study applied clustered and identified results to build a minimum distance classifier to identify help-seeking behavior patterns in new data. The study also investigated the accuracy of the classifier in early identifying help-seeking behavior patterns from early-stage data. The early identification accuracy was 61\% for the first three minutes and 75\% for the seven-minutes of early-stage data, respectively. Fifth, this study identified three help-seeking tendencies: independent problem-solvers, executive help-seekers, and static instrumental and executive help-seekers.

However, less discussion is conducted about whether and how to personalize the strategies to generate recommendations based on student differences. In this study, we aim at investigating how students judge recommendations based on different strategies, and how these judgments relate to student characteristics. We conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey to measure students' Big-Five personality traits, confidence in the subjects, and their judgments on six types of recommendations. The answers collected from 735 high school students in Japan indicate that students had different judgments across different recommendation strategies, but similarly for English and mathematics. Furthermore, the correlations between student characteristics and their judgments on recommendations were stronger if the subject to learn was inconsistent with the subject they preferred. The results provide insights on how to design educational recommendations that not only cater to students' traits, but also help foster and enhance their traits for better learning."","""",""10.1186/s40561-024-00349-y , Article-Number = 61 , EISSN = 2196-7091"",Educational recommender systems K12 education Confidence Personality traits";Keywords-Plus = SELF-EFFICACY ACHIEVEMENT STRATEGY BELIEFS GOALS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = dai.yiling.4t@kyoto-u.ac.jp hoppe.heinz.2v@kyoto-u.ac.jp flanagan.brendanjohn.4n@k...;Affiliations = Kyoto University Kyoto University,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"rayyan-358097784,Beyond recommendation acceptance: explanation's learning effects in a math recommender system,2024,,,Research and Practice in Technology Enhanced Learning,,19,,,""Dai, Yiling and Takami, Kyosuke and Flanagan, Brendan and Ogata, Hiroaki"",,,,,""Recommender systems can provide personalized advice on learning for individual students. Providing explanations of those recommendations are expected to increase the transparency and persuasiveness of the system, thus improve students' adoption of the recommendation. Little research has explored the explanations' practical effects on learning performance except for the acceptance of recommended learning activities. The recommendation explanations can improve the learning performance if the explanations are designed to contribute to relevant learning skills. This study conducted a comparative experiment (N = 276) in high school classrooms, aiming to investigate whether the use of an explainable math recommender system improves students' learning performance. We found that the presence of the explanations had positive effects on students' learning improvement and perceptions of the systems, but not the number of solved quizzes during the learning task. These results imply the possibility that the recommendation explanations may affect students' meta-cognitive skills and their perceptions, which further contribute to students' learning improvement. When separating the students based on their prior math abilities, we found a significant correlation between the number of viewed recommendations and the final learning improvement for the students with lower math abilities. This indicates that the students with lower math abilities may benefit from reading their learning progress indicated in the explanations. For students with higher math abilities, their learning improvement was more related to the behavior to select and solve recommended quizzes, which indicates a necessity of more sophisticated and interactive recommender system."","""",""10.58459/rptel.2024.19020 , Article-Number = 20 , EISSN = 1793-7078"",Recommender system Explainable recommender system Educational recommender system Learning perform...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = dai.yiling.4t@kyoto-u.ac.jp;Affiliations = Kyoto University Kyoto University Kyoto University,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite its wide adoption, the high dropout rates are a reason for concern for teachers and institutional managers. There are initiatives to mitigate this situation, such as Educational Data Mining (EDM), Learning Analytics (LA), and the use of Recommendation Systems (RS). Although effective in specific aspects, these techniques lack mechanisms for students' motivation and pedagogical intervention by teachers, as they do not present methodological proposals to encourage learning. Therefore, this article describes an RS model that shows a differential integration of the pedagogical approach of Active Methodologies with the support of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics techniques to identify students with dropout risks and enhance permanence. For this, a prototype was implemented, and a case study was carried out with professors from two universities to assess functionality and acceptance. According to the TAM Model, more than 87\% of teachers agree with the ease of use, and 77\% agree that RS can be helpful in students' teaching and learning process.

The intended feedback is a personalized set of test questions (items) for each student that they could benefit from practicing with. Recommended items can be beneficial for students as they can support their learning process by targeting specific gaps in their knowledge, especially when there is little time to get feedback from instructors. The items are recommended using several commonly used recommender system algorithms, and are based on the students' scores in a summative assessment. The results show that in the context of the Dutch secondary education final examinations, item recommendations can be made to students with an acceptable level of model performance. Furthermore, it does not take a computationally complex model to do so: a simple baseline model which takes into account global, student-specific, and item-specific averages obtained similar performance to more complex models. Overall, we conclude that recommender systems are a promising tool for helping students in their learning process by combining multiple data sources and new methodologies, without putting additional strain on their instructors."","""",""10.3389/feduc.2021.652070 , Article-Number = 652070 , EISSN = 2504-284X"",educational assessment summative assessment feedback recommender systems collaborative filtering";Keywords-Plus = METAANALYSIS MATRIX TESTS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = eva.deschipper@cito.nl;Affiliations = University of Twente,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Surface anatomy is an essential part of the learning process that allows students an opportunity to identify anatomical structures on living people and to develop their palpation and tactile skills for physical examinations of patients. Body painting is a student-centred, engaging, and motivating approach to learn surface anatomy in anatomy practical classes. In this study, anatomy learning was extended ``beyond the classroom '' through extra-curricular body painting projects. These projects were run by student teams consisting of a student model, student artists (4-5), and a student photographer, under the direction of the chief investigator. A total of sixteen body painting projects were carried out from 2010 to show the skeletal system, the muscular system, pregnancy, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, and the neurovascular systems of the entire body. A SurveyMonkey of 31/41 active participants suggested that participants enjoyed the projects (94-100\%), found them relevant to their future profession (80-87\%), and considered them to assist with deeper understanding (94\%) and long-term memory (93\%) of anatomy.

By employing rhetorical devices when speaking about technology topics, IT professionals can present logical and convincing arguments, and demonstrate their knowledge and expertise while engaging the audience and making complex technical concepts more accessible for non-experts. This study attempts to understand how IT students construct and develop persuasive arguments by analysing their use of rhetorical strategies in a sample of persuasive presentations delivered in the course ``English for IT '' . Both corpus analysis and manual analysis were used to identify different types of rhetorical strategies students employed to influence their audiences' attitudes. The results show that IT students not only created a logical appeal which might be more natural for them but also employed a wide range of rhetorical strategies and devices to establish disciplinary credibility and create a more personal connection with their audience, thus maintaining an appropriate balance of logos, ethos and pathos.

However, it is often difficult for users to interpret their meaning. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that transforms dense vectors into human-readable lexical representations using a percentile-based mapping approach. The essence of the approach is a mapping of words from a predefined/custom lexicon to vectors based on their relative local magnitudes. This way, it enables intuitive visualization of the semantic similarities and differences between complex data points and allows for domain-specific interpretability. It provides an easy way to deduplicate dense vectors (even near-duplicates) and can generate locality-aware hash-like representations, which can be used for efficient indexing and retrieval in various applications. The approach has also been implemented in an open-source library called LangVec.

The global outbreak of COVID-19 has further accelerated the adoption of online learning as education service providers are forced to move their courses online to ensure the continuity of education. However, with many online courses, learners often find it challenging to select courses that meet their preferences and requirements. To address this issue, recommender systems (RS) have emerged as a popular solution for automatically analysing data and providing personalised recommendations to learners. Our previous work proposed a course RS based on the skyline block-nested-loops (BNL) algorithm. This algorithm filters courses based on multiple criteria, such as course duration, price, difficulty level, and rating, allowing learners to select courses that meet their specific preferences. However, the skyline BNL algorithm has limitations when learners must consider several criteria simultaneously. This limitation led us to propose a new RS that combines skyline BNL and top-k weighted sum (top-kws). The top-kws algorithm ranks courses based on a weighted sum of their features, allowing learners to select courses based on their relative importance."","""",10.1504/IJLT.2025.145212,multi-criteria recommender systems courses recommendation system skyline BNL algorithm top-kws al...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = a.errafyg@um5r.ac.ma a.idrissi@um5r.ac.ma kaoutar.elhandri@isga.ma;Affiliations = Mohammed V University in Rabat,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Fraud is indicated by any significant deviation from normal behavior. The mechanism suffers from three disadvantages. Limited observations from the historical data, assorted nature of transaction data, and highly distorted information lead to unusually high positive failure rates of anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose a ranking metric embedding-based multi-contextual behavior profiling (ReMEMBeR) model to incorporate the detection mechanism effectively. We transform the original anomaly detection problem into a pseudo-recommender system problem and solve it using a ranking metric embedding-based method. With collaborative filtering, an individual could utilize information from similar individuals implicitly and automatically, which alleviates the individual's possible lack of historical data. By the ranking scheme, the model is trained to maximize the ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This helps to make full use of label information and, thus, solves the data skewness problem to the utmost extent. The proposed model integrates multi-contextual behaviour patterns, from purely local to more global ones. Evaluating transactions against multi- contextual behaviour patterns could reduce the error rate and, hence, could bring down the false positive rate. By creating a contrast vector for each transaction based on the customer's past behavior sequence, we profile the differentiation rate of each current transaction against the customer's behavior preference."","""",10.9756/INT-JECSE/V14I2.499,Anomaly detection ReMEMBeR multi-contextual behavior profiling filtering online banking fraud det...";Keywords-Plus = E-COMMERCE TRANSACTIONS CARD FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education;Special;Author-Email = ags.cse@rmd.ac.in psr.cse@rmd.ac.in ucs18106@rmd.ac.in ucs18111@rmd.ac.in ucs18123...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CIDHR is freely accessible to everyone, with a focus on French-speaking resources. CIDHR has been initiated to provide validated, high-quality content tailored to the specific needs of each user profile, be it students or professionals. Objective: This study's primary aim in developing and implementing the CIDHR is to improve knowledge sharing and spreading in digital health and health informatics and expand the health-related educational community, primarily French speaking but also in other languages. We intend to support the continuous development of initial (ie, bachelor level), advanced (ie, master and doctoral levels), and continuing training (ie, professionals and postgraduate levels) in digital health for health and social work fields. The main objective is to describe the development and implementation of CIDHR. The hypothesis guiding this research is that controlled vocabularies dedicated to medical informatics and digital health, such as the Medical Informatics Multilingual Ontology (MIMO) and the concepts structuring the French National Referential on Digital Health (FNRDH), to index digital health teaching and learning resources, are effectively increasing the availability and accessibility of these resources to medical students and other health care professionals. Methods: First, resource identification is processed by medical librarians from websites and scientific sources preselected and validated by domain experts and surveyed every week. Then, based on MIMO and FNRDH, the educational resources are indexed for each related knowledge domain. The same resources are also tagged with relevant academic and professional experience levels. Afterward, the indexed resources are shared with the digital health teaching and learning community. The last step consists of assessing CIDHR by obtaining informal feedback from users. Results: Resource identification and evaluation processes were executed by a dedicated team of medical librarians, aiming to collect and curate an extensive collection of digital health teaching and learning resources. The resources that successfully passed the evaluation process were promptly included in CIDHR. These resources were diligently indexed (with MIMO and FNRDH) and tagged for the study field and degree level. By October 2023, a total of 371 indexed resources were available on a dedicated portal. Conclusions: CIDHR is a multilingual digital health education semantic search engine and platform that aims to increase the accessibility of educational resources to the broader health care-related community. It focuses on making resources ``findable, '' ``accessible, '' ``interoperable, '' and ``reusable '' by using a one -stop shop portal approach. CIDHR has and will have an essential role in increasing digital health literacy."","""",""10.2196/48393 , Article-Number = e48393"",digital health medical informatics medical education search engine knowledge management semantic ...";Keywords-Plus = INFORMATICS COOPERATION;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education;Scientific Disciplines;Author-Email = julien.grosjean@chu-rouen.fr;Affiliations = Universite de Rouen Normandie CHU de Rouen Sorbonne Universite Institut National d...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"rayyan-358097806,Memory-Based Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Learner Modeling: Towards Early Prediction of Learners' Performance in Computational Thinking,2024,,,Education Sciences,,14,8,,""Hooshyar, Danial and Druzdzel, Marek J."",,,,,""Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in addressing educational challenges in digital learning. Despite this potential, there are still concerns about the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI methods. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) not only provide interpretability and the ability to integrate data-driven insights with expert judgment for enhanced trustworthiness but also effectively process temporal dynamics and relationships in data, crucial for early predictive modeling tasks. This research introduces an approach for the temporal modeling of learners' computational thinking abilities that incorporates higher-order influences of latent variables (hereafter referred to as memory of the model) and accordingly predicts learners' performance early. Our findings on educational data from the AutoThinking game indicate that when using only first-order influences, our proposed model can predict learners' performance early, with an 86\% overall accuracy (i.e., time stamps 0, 5, and 9) and a 94\% AUC (at the last time stamp) during cross-validation and 91\% accuracy and 98\% AUC (at the last time stamp) in a holdout test. The introduction of higher-order influences improves model accuracy in both cross-validation and holdout tests by roughly 4\% and improves the AUC at timestamp 0 by roughly 2\%. This suggests that integrating higher-order influences into a DBN not only potentially improves the model's predictive accuracy during the cross-validation phase but also enhances its overall and time stamp-specific generalizability. DBNs with higher-order influences offer a trustworthy and interpretable tool for educators to foresee and support learning progression."","""",""10.3390/educsci14080917 , Article-Number = 917 , EISSN = 2227-7102"",early prediction learner modeling dynamic Bayesian network interpretable and trustworthy AI compu...";Keywords-Plus = INTERPRETABLE AI KNOWLEDGE STATE;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = danial.hooshyar@tlu.ee m.druzdzel@pb.edu.pl;Affiliations = Tallinn University Bialystok University of Technology,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While adaptive supports have been shown to improve the effectiveness of educational games, improperly customized support can have negative effects on learning outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel approach, called DeepLM, that considers a series of time windows representing both sequences of learners' actions during gameplay and estimation of their current competencies (using stealth assessment) to model learners and accordingly predict their future performance. The approach employs a variant of deep neural networks to early predict learners' midterm and final scores simultaneously. The results show that using 20-50\% of learners' action sequences can early predict their final scores, with a cross-validated convolutional neural network (CNN) achieving an area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.879 and 85.3\%, respectively. The same model can also achieve high accuracy in predicting midterm and final scores at the same time, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.848 and 77.9\%. Overall, the CNN model outperforms recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) models in predicting learners' final performance and performs better than the baseline MLP model in predicting learners' midterm and final performance using both cross-validation and independent datasets. These findings show the potential of the proposed approach in accurately early predicting learners' performance, allowing educators and game designers to tailor interventions and support mechanisms that could lead to optimized learning outcomes."","""",10.34105/j.kmel.2024.16.019,Stealth assessment Predictive learner modelling Deep neural networks Adaptive supports Educationa...";Keywords-Plus = GAME PERCEPTIONS STUDENTS RISK;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = danial.hooshyar@tlu.ee nour.el-mawas@univ-lorraine.fr yeongwook.yang@gmail.com;Affiliations = Tallinn University Universite de Lorraine Gangneung-Wonju National University;Funding-Acknowledgement = Tallinn University project entitled ``Fostering the research strand in ...;2021R1C1C2004868] National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [ 2021R1C...;Funding-Text = This work was supported by the Tallinn University project entitled ``Fostering the...;the COPCOT (ANR-22-CE38-0003) project funded by the Agence Nationale de Recherche;and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (...;Number-of-Cited-References = 46;Times-Cited = 0;Usage-Count-Last-180-days = 3;Usage-Count-Since-2013 = 4;Journal-ISO = Knowl.

To provide students with more sustained and personalized advising, many HEIs turn to online academic advising systems and tools as a way to minimize costs and streamline their advising services. However, in such systems, uncertainty in the learner's parameters is a factor, which makes the decision-making process more difficult. Fuzzy logic, a multivalued logic similar to human thinking and interpretation, is highly suitable and applicable for developing knowledge-based academic advising systems that conserve the inherent fuzziness in learner models. In this paper, an innovative hybrid software infrastructure is presented which integrates expert system, fuzzy reasoning, and ontological tools to provide reliable recommendations to students for the next appropriate learning step. The software comprises a fuzzy logic component that determines the student's interest degree for a specific academic choice accompanied by an ontological model and a conventional rule-based expert system for the composition of personalized learning pathways. In order for the system to recommend the next step of the learning pathway, the output of the fuzzy logic component together with the knowledge that is modeled as part of the multi-facet ontology and the machine perceptible academic advising guidelines expressed as semantic rules interoperate in a dynamic and seamless manner.

Through a comprehensive content analysis of learners' responses, we employed a blend of manual scrutiny, Python-generated Word Cloud, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to expose the nature of interaction between learners and AI tools. Our findings indicate that learners predominantly adhere to the perception of AI as a tool resembling a `brush' in the creative process, rather than as an active co-creator - the percaption that is aligned with the conventional tool-user dynamic. Students articulated a dual narrative regarding AI: they acknowledged its utility in enhancing creativity, yet expressed concerns about overreliance potentially eroding their own creative skills. Heidegger's exploration of different modes of `revealing' and Deleuze and Guattari's notions of desiring machines and machinic enslavement suggest an alternative perspective where technology, and by extension AI-empowered technology, can contribute to a deeper existential understanding. This study points out the possibility of moving beyond a simple tool-user model, suggesting the emergence of more complex plausible scenarios of interaction: poietic symbiosis or algorithmic subjugation."","""",""10.1007/s10639-024-12877-8 , EarlyAccessDate = JUL 2024"",Advertising message Applications Artificial intelligence (AI) Deleuze Generative AI (GenAI)";education Heidegger Lerner-facing Marketing communications;Keywords-Plus = TUTORING SYSTEM INTELLIGENT COMPREHENSION FEEDBACK SKILLS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = gulnara.z.karimova@gmail.com volam@inbox.ru Amir.shirkhanbeik@gmail.com;Affiliations = KIMEP University Eastern Mediterranean University,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition, the instability of the labor market and the complexity of life have a great impact on young people's career choices. Faced with these concerns, high school students get confused when choosing a college major. Furthermore, the explosion of data on the Internet has caused most of the Internet users to make possible unsuitable decisions when browsing the Web, due to their inability to handle such large amounts of data. In this paper, the Case-based reasoning, and Ontology-based Hybrid Recommender System (COHRS) is proposed to assist high school students deciding the appropriate university/college, university major and career domain that best fit their preferences. COHRS uniquely combines case-based reasoning, collaborative filtering, knowledge base and ontology to explore the top N recommendations based on their fields of interest. The system has been evaluated on Lebanese students through a real-life dataset collected from different Lebanese cities. The first tests carried out on 60 high school students in Beirut city showed an average satisfaction level of 91.7\% of the recommended results from the proposed system and 93.3\% of them found the system very useful. The proposed system achieved an average accuracy level of 98\% and 95\% to retrieve the most similar cases and to extract appropriate recommendations respectively, which provides a very insightful capability to guide high school students in their future directions."","""",""10.1007/s11423-025-10488-9 , EarlyAccessDate = MAR 2025"",Adult learning Applications in education Recommender system High school Ontology";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = christine.lahoud@ufe.edu.eg sherin.moussa@ufe.edu.eg cobeid@liris.cnrs.fr hkhoury@...;Affiliations = Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB) Ain Shams University Institut National des Sciences ...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Adaptive assessments using cognitive diagnostic models provide significant advantages over fixed-length RBAs commonly used in physics education research. As part of a broader project to develop a cognitive diagnostic assessment for introductory mechanics within an evidence-centered design framework, we identified and tested the student models of four skills that cross content areas in introductory physics: apply vectors, conceptual relationships, algebra, and visualizations. We developed the student models in three steps. First, we based the model on learning objectives from instructors. Second, we coded the items on RBAs using the student models. Finally, we then tested and refined this coding using a common cognitive diagnostic model, the deterministic inputs, noisy ``and '' gate model. The data included 19 889 students who completed either the Force Concept Inventory, Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, or Energy and Momentum Conceptual Survey on the LASSO platform.

Furthermore, the study investigates whether a game's aesthetics and mechanics support players' intrinsic motivation. Both claims are tested through the design, implementation and pilot use of the Multiplication Game (MG). MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils' performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics.

ITSs' personalized support is mainly achieved by providing individual prompts to learners when they encounter difficulties in problem-solving. The guiding principles and methods of prompts have been less investigated in previous ITS literatures. Based on relevant learning theories, such as self-regulated learning theory, zone of proximal development, scaffolding and heuristic teaching, we proposed seven guiding principles for designing ITS prompts and designed the guiding and adaptive prompts for the difficult questions in a mathematical ITS, math intelligent assessment and teaching system V2.0. In order to verify the effectiveness of this ITS with the aforementioned prompts, we conducted a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment in a high school, where the experimental group followed a process of ``pretest, practice with general prompts and adaptive tutoring, and posttest, '' while the control group followed a process of ``pretest, practice with only general prompts, and posttest. '' We collected the pre and posttest scores of both the experimental and control groups, and log data from the student model within the ITS for the experimental group students. The data analysis indicated that although the experimental group scored lower than the control group in the pretest, they scored higher in the posttest and spent less completion time. The drilled problems and the prompts provided to the experimental group students were personalized. In conclusion, the design principles for guiding and adaptive prompts in the ITS can provide personalized guidance and support for students, thus effectively improve their performance. Those principles are not only valuable for the subject mathematics but also can contribute significantly to the prompt design of other subjects, thereby bolstering the global pursuit of personalized education."","""",10.1109/TLT.2024.3382000,Guiding and adaptive prompts instructional support intelligent tutoring system (ITS) math intelli...";Research-Areas = Computer Science Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Computer Science;Interdisciplinary Applications Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = liuhuaiya@pku.edu.cn persistbetter@stu.pku.edu.cn jjy@pku.edu.cn;Affiliations = Peking University,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A large number of existing studies in course recommendation systems focus on the accuracy of prediction to show students the most relevant courses with little consideration on interactivity and user perception. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of user-perceived aspects of recommendation systems, such as transparency, controllability, and user satisfaction. This paper introduces CourseQ, an interactive course recommendation system that allows students to explore courses by using a novel visual interface so as to improve transparency and user satisfaction of course recommendations. We describe the design concepts, interactions, and algorithm of the proposed system. A within-subject user study (N=32) was conducted to evaluate our system compared to a baseline interface without the proposed interactive visualization. The evaluation results show that our system improves many user-centric metrics including user acceptance and understanding of the recommendation results. Furthermore, our analysis of user interaction behaviors in the system indicates that CourseQ could help different users with their course-seeking tasks.

This is especially true in the education domain, the more about the student is known, the more useful recommendations can be made. However, although many studies on the course recommendation exist, studies on the students' course selection motivations in universities are limited. This study investigates the factors that contribute to students' choice when selecting courses in universities to better understand student perceptions, attitudes, and needs and leverage data-driven approaches for recommending and explaining the recommendations in university environments. A qualitative interview for university students (N = 10) comprised of open-ended questions as well as a questionnaire for students (N = 81) was conducted, aiming to investigate the main reasons behind their choices. The results of this study show that students highly value the course contents and the benefits of the course towards their future careers. Furthermore, students are influenced by other reasons such as the possibility of obtaining a higher grade, the popularity of professors, and recommendations from peers. Next, we extract the main categories of students' motivations and analyzed the questionnaire data by employing statistical analysis methods as well as the k-means clustering algorithm to identify different types of students in terms of course selection.

Particularly, learning computer application operating skills is essential for students because excellent computer application operating skills can help them attain good jobs. However, when fostering students' computer application operating skills by teaching in vocational high school using the learning by doing strategy, a teacher learns that helping all students, evaluating their learning problems, and providing feedback to correct their mistakes are challenging. After investigating the challenge, a machine-learning-based peer tutor recommender system (MPTRS) with automated assessment was proposed to enhance students' learning performance in computer application operating skills. The advanced automated assessment system (AAS) used computer vision technology to evaluate student assignments and instantly return feedback. The recommendation mechanism of the MPTRS enhanced mutual help among students based on their social relationships, learning performance, and recommendation feedback. Furthermore, machine-learning techniques were used to improve recommendations. In the experiment, the experimental group used the proposed system, and the control group used a conventional commercial automated grading system. From the experimental results, the learning performance of the experimental group significantly improved between the pretest and post-test. Students can correct and complete more assignments using the advanced AAS and students who behind in learning also can use the peer tutor recommender function for asking help.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognise the ethical considerations surrounding this technology, as it heavily relies on gathering and analysing students' data, which could potentially affect their level of engagement and trust in online learning settings. This study delves into the ethical considerations surrounding e-learning recommender systems and their impact on students' behaviours, particularly in relation to privacy concerns, trust, and engagement within the online educational environment. The research emphasises various influential factors such as the transparency of the platform, previous exposure to cybersecurity education, and students' backgrounds, including their gender and educational level. The investigation involved 602 students from various academic levels across 11 distinct regions in Morocco, encompassing both rural and urban areas. Among the key findings from the Structural Modelling Analysis (SEM) is that the level of transparency on online learning platforms is a significant factor in building students' trust. However, an excess of transparency can have the opposite effect, leading to disengagement as students become overwhelmed with information. The study also revealed an inverse relationship between cybersecurity education and platform transparency, as increased knowledge can lead to a more critical examination of platform regulation and a heightened awareness of privacy risks. In addition, the research found that individuals with higher levels of education have better cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills, enabling them to understand transparency better. Interestingly, those with higher education also tend to have fewer privacy concerns, likely due to their confidence in security measures and understanding of data handling practices."","""",""10.1007/s10639-024-12979-3 , EarlyAccessDate = AUG 2024"",Recommender system Data privacy SEM analysis Trust E-learning Student Engagement Cybersecurity ed...";Keywords-Plus = SECURITY;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = hajar.majjate@usmba.ac.ma;Affiliations = Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University of Fez Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University o...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Moreover, their decisions should match their academic background, interests, and goals to pursue their passions and discover various career paths with motivation. However, such a decision remains challenging are unfamiliar with the job market, the demand for the required skills, and being in the proper placement in a major is not straightforward. Thus, an automatic recommendation system can be helpful for students to assist and guide them in the right decision. In this context, we developed a machine learning model to predict and recommend suitable specializations for undergraduate students according to the job market and student's academic history. Two hundred twenty-five records of students are considered to establish this work. The proposed approach encompasses four major steps, including data preprocessing to clean, scale, and prepare the data for training to avoid obtaining suboptimal results, accompanied by an oversampling process to equal the samples' distribution to prevent the model from being biased or poorly generalized. Furthermore, we conducted a feature selection step using Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) to extract the relevant features to improve the outcomes and reduce the risk of noise. The selected subset is used to train the model using the AdaBoost classifier. We deployed the Genetic algorithm to optimize the classifier's hyperparameters to maximize results. As a result, the findings of this study exhibit noticeable results compared to existing models, with an accuracy of 98.1\%.

Nevertheless, MOOC courses' diversity and standard adjustments make it harder for learners to distinguish the best ones that match their profile and needs. In this context, we developed a Machine Learning model that uses learners' profile information and their interaction history with MOOC platforms to predict and recommend relevant MOOCs. One of the large-scale datasets is used to perform this work, which contains 16 courses and 16 features. Data preprocessing is conducted to clean, scale, and prepare the data for training to avoid having suboptimal results, along with an undersampling to adjust the distribution of samples in classes to prevent poor generalization and bias models. In fact, dealing with a large set of attributes often needs to be diminished to increase the model's performance and reduce the risk of noise and the model's overfitting. In this way, we applied the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) to select the appropriate features for the target classes. The resulting subset of features was then used to train the model using the Decision Tree classifier.

This convergent mixed-methods study, guided by a transformative paradigm emphasizing ethical engagement and social justice, evaluated the implementation of the AfriMEDS framework, a local adaptation of CanMEDS incorporating community-based education (CBE) and community-oriented primary care (COPC) at the University of the Free State (UFS). Methods included curriculum mapping, document analysis, 15 educator interviews, and surveys of 71 medical interns. Document review revealed that health advocate, leader and manager, and scholar roles were minimally featured in phase guides and that existing assessment tools diverged from CanMEDS recommendations. Educator interviews identified three principal barriers: insufficient faculty development (87\% of participants), resource constraints, and misaligned assessment practices. Intern surveys showed only 63\% felt leadership training was adequate, 71\% felt prepared for CBE, and 72\% felt competent in collaboration. These findings expose critical gaps in embedding AfriMEDS competencies, particularly intrinsic roles, within undergraduate training. Our methodological framework highlights how CBE and COPC can serve as catalysts for meaningful curricular reform by fostering sustained collaboration between learners, educators, and communities. We recommend systemic reforms including decolonial pedagogical strategies, robust faculty development in cultural competency, alignment of curricula with national health priorities, and the creation of benchmarked assessment tools that reflect African healthcare contexts and community needs.

The framework extracts features from multiple perspectives to describe behaviors more comprehensively, including statistical features and association features. In addition, a multi-task model is designed for fine-grained prediction of students' learning performance in the curriculum. A framework for predicting mastery based on online learning behavior is also put forward. Additional context information is added to the collaborative filtering algorithm including student-knowledge-point mastery, class-knowledge-point, and students' mastery is predicted according to the learning path excavated. Considering the time-varying of mastery, the approximate curve of students' mastery of knowledge points is fitted according to the Ebinhaus forgetting curve. The experiments show that the proposed framework has a high recall rate for the prediction of learning performance and also shows a certain practicability for early warning. Further, based on the model, the correlation between student behavior patterns and learning performance is discussed. The inclusion of additional information has improved the prediction efficiency, especially the operational efficiency. At the same time, the proposed framework can not only dynamically assess students' master of knowledge but also facilitate the system to review feedback or adjust the learning order and provide personalized learning services."","""",10.3991/ijet.v15i06.13175,Education data mining student behavior pattern sequential pattern mining learning performance pre...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = 276677761@qq.com;Affiliations = Hunan University of Arts & Science;Number-of-Cited-References = 9;Times-Cited = 6;Usage-Count-Last-180-days = 1;Usage-Count-Since-2013 = 22;Journal-ISO = Int.

This led to the research question: ``Can a new serious game be designed, incorporating knowledge tracing algorithms to deliver personalised learning experiences in telecommunications education? '' In response, an escape-themed serious game was developed, integrating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing as a statistical student model for personalised learning. This innovative approach combines free-roam gameplay with tailored educational content, significantly advancing serious game design.

In relation to AI competence, results indicate that affective attitudes predicted awareness and usage, leading to information avoidance and disengagement. Cognitive attitudes positively predicted AI awareness and usage. Behavioural attitudes, however, did not predict awareness or usage, suggesting that individuals may engage with AI technology without deeper understanding. For AI conceptions, behavioural attitudes were more closely linked to conceptions of AI in educational contexts. Positive behavioural attitudes predicted students' conceptions of AI's role in intelligent tutoring systems, retentions, drop-out reduction, recommendation systems, and personalised learning. In contrast, affective attitudes predicted conceptions of AI's use in classroom monitoring and performance prediction, while cognitive attitudes had little influence.

The clustering phase served as a foundation for deriving insights into student learning behaviors. To assess the clustering quality, we applied the silhouette score to quantify intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation, which provided statistical validation for our approach. Following the clustering process, we developed a recommendation system based on the user-based nearest neighbors collaborative filtering approach. This system tailors educational strategies to the unique characteristics of each cluster, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we compared our methodology against alternative clustering and recommendation techniques to demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness. Our findings suggest that this combined clustering and recommendation framework offers a data-driven approach to personalized education, which can be extended beyond the KALBOARD360 dataset to other educational contexts.

KT aims to assess a student's knowledge state based on past performance and predict the correctness of the next question. Traditional KT often treats questions with different difficulty levels of the same concept as identical representations, limiting the effectiveness of question embedding. Additionally, higher-order semantic relationships between questions are overlooked. Graph models have been employed in KT to enhance question embedding representation, but they rarely consider the directed relationships between learning interactions. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach, KT through Enhanced Questions and Directed Learning Interaction Based on multigraph embeddings in ITSs (MGEKT), to address these limitations. One channel enhances question embedding representation by capturing relationships between students, concepts, and questions. This channel defines two meta paths, facilitating the learning of high-order semantic relationships between questions. The other channel constructs a directed graph of learning interactions, leveraging graph attention convolution to illustrate their intricate relationships. A new gating mechanism is proposed to capture long-term dependencies and emphasize critical information when tracing students' knowledge states. Notably, MGEKT employs reverse knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from two small models (student models) to a large model (teacher model). This knowledge distillation enhances the model's generalization performance and improves the perception of crucial information. In comparative evaluations across four datasets, MGEKT outperformed baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in KT."","""",""10.1109/TE.2024.3448532 , EarlyAccessDate = SEP 2024"",Hidden Markov models Semantics Predictive models History Data models Computational modeling Train...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research Engineering;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education;Scientific Disciplines Engineering;Electrical & Electronic;Author-Email = qiuliqing2019@163.com wanglulu@sdust.edu.cn;Affiliations = Shandong University of Science & Technology,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students' abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a Big Data platform is constructed to collect students' various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student's utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of our proposed team building method not only has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms."","""",10.1109/TLT.2023.3343525,Buildings Optimization Education Behavioral sciences Technological innovation Particle swarm opti...";Keywords-Plus = PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM;Research-Areas = Computer Science Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Computer Science;Interdisciplinary Applications Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = dapengqu@lnu.edu.cn 1354942870@qq.com tianqiyang0@163.com songlinwu8@163.com wangx...;Affiliations = Liaoning University Northeastern University - China State University of New York (...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The velocity of learning content creation and its availability is also growing exponentially day after day. It is challenging for a learner to find a learning path for a course with a vast content repository. So, recommending a learning path helps the learners streamline the learning materials systematically and achieve their goals. This article proposes a learning path recommendation approach focused on knowledge building and learning performance analysis. The model considers both static and dynamic learner parameters for learning path generation. The difficulty level of the learning resources is tuned based on the real-time performance analysis of the students. The learning resources are recommended based on learning preferences and the ability of a learner to learn the specific learning resource. The model also predicts the learning time and the expected score for each learner. Root Mean Square Deviation and Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared error) measures are used to find the correctness of the prediction. The model is also checked for its adaptivity to the learners' changing behavior and diversity of the LOs recommended for different learners. Ninety-six undergraduate learners participated in the study. The experimentations are conducted with 530 LOs from selected courses. The comparison results with three existing models show a better performance from the proposed approach with an average accuracy rise of 30\% in learning path prediction based on the expected duration of learning 27.8\% in expected score prediction with the second-best performing model. It is observed that the real-time learning analytics using the implicit learner log data benefits the recommendation process. LO rating strongly indicated the enhancement of learner satisfaction and experience with a rise of 25.5\% when comparing the rating share with the second-best model."","""",""10.1007/s40692-022-00250-y , EarlyAccessDate = DEC 2022"",Recommender systems Personalized learning Learning paths Learning environments E-learning";Keywords-Plus = PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM GENERATION STUDENTS STYLES;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = nishasraj@cusat.ac.in;Affiliations = Cochin University Science & Technology;Number-of-Cited-References = 58;Times-Cited = 20;Usage-Count-Last-180-days = 2;Usage-Count-Since-2013 = 60;Journal-ISO = J.

We were able to identify 24 virtual reading clubs, which we contacted once again to carry out our study. The conclusions shed light on the activities organized to encourage reading in Spain: the groups present a diverse set of operating rules and platforms, but the user profile is homogeneous and the assessments made by its participants are positive. These conclusions may help to identify good practices and may help to guide the design of new virtual reading clubs and the reorientation of those already in operation.

P. and Viana, Windson"",,,,,""Adaptive learning is a teaching approach aiming to personalize the learning experience for each student. In Computer Science Education (CSE), Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) can provide students with customized lessons, exercises, and assessments based on their previous knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses. Some literature reviews focus on adaptive learning techniques, but none specifically analyze the methods used in adaptive systems in CSE. Our overall objective is to identify the computing techniques that are implemented within ALS to provide adaptive computer education in higher education. We conducted a scoping review (SR) based on the Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, defining six research questions and a search string. We performed searches in four databases, retrieving 512 documents. After applying the selection criteria, we selected 29 works. The results present quantitative and qualitative data from those 29 studies. Most research has used adaptive learning in programming education (12 articles) and databases (9 papers). Nine articles used learning styles as the core of adaptation, with the Felder-Silverman model being used by seven of them. The most commonly used approach was the rule-based system approach built by experts within the proposal, which was used in 17.24\% of the articles. Clustering, collaborative filtering, fuzzy logic, and K-NN were used in 10.34\% of the proposals. The positive aspect of ``delivering adaptive content '' was pointed out in seven articles. As for negative aspects, the problem of lack of student engagement was mentioned in four articles. This study discusses the application of dynamic and static models based on learning styles (LS) and the challenges involved in their use. Additionally, another aspect pointed out is that it is crucial to carefully consider pedagogical aspects in learning systems and have mixed development teams. The study also discusses student motivation and the use of gamification elements as a strategy to engage students in electronic learning systems. Finally, the results also indicate that the level of student knowledge is typically represented by a student model (SM), and the growing trend is the use of hybrid SMs. The research identified the most studied areas in ALS in CSE, such as computer programming and databases. The most common techniques used in ALS were rule-based systems built by experts, fuzzy logic, and clustering. The most common feature of ALS identified was learning resources, and the majority of studies focused on investigating the impact of system accuracy. This research can help researchers design better adaptive learning systems and understand challenges that need to be addressed."","""",""10.1007/s10639-023-12066-z , EarlyAccessDate = SEP 2023"",Adaptive learning Computer education Learning styles Scoping review";Keywords-Plus = PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE TECHNOLOGY TPACK;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = pedro.barbosa@ifce.edu.br carmorafael@virtual.ufc.br jpaulo@dc.ufc.br windson@virt...;Affiliations = Universidade Federal do Ceara,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

On the other hand, long-term motivation indicates a sort of continuing commitment that is required to complete assigned task. As short-term motivational problems span for a limited period of time, such as a session, therefore, they need to be addressed in real time to keep the learner engaged in the learning process. Similarly, long-term learners' motivation plays an equally important role to retain the learner in the long run and minimize the risk of dropout. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to incorporate a comprehensive learner motivation model that is based on short-term and long-term aspects of the learners' motivation. This approach enables Web-based educational systems to identify the real-time motivational state of the learner and provide personalized interventions to keep the learners engaged in learning process. Design/methodology/approach Recent research regarding personalized Web-based educational systems demonstrates learner's motivation to be an essential component of the learning model. This is because of the fact that low motivation results in either students' less engagement or complete drop out from the learning activities. A learner motivation model is considered to be a set of perceptions and beliefs that the system has developed about a learner. This includes both short-term and long-term motivations of leaners. Findings This study proposed a framework of a domain independent learners' motivation model based on firm educational theories. The proposed framework consists of two modules. The primary module deals with real-time identification of motivation and logging off activities such as login, forum participation and adherence to assessment deadline. Secondary module maintains the profile of leaners associated with both short-term and long-term motivation. A study was conducted to verify the impact of learners' motivation model and personalized interventional strategies based on proposed model, using Systematical Information Education Method assessment standards. The results show an increase in motivational index and the characteristics associated with motivation during the conducted study. Originality/value Motivational diagnosis is important for both traditional classrooms and Web-based education systems. It is one of the major elements that contribute in the success of the learning process. However, dropout rate among online students is very high, which leads to incorporate motivational elements in more personalized way because motivated students will retain the course until they successfully complete it. Hence, identifying learner's motivation, updating learners' motivation model based on this identification and providing personalized interventions are the key for the success of Web-based educational systems."","""",10.1108/ITSE-09-2020-0207,E-learning Motivation model Adaptation Real-time learner modeling Web-based education systems Hig...";Keywords-Plus = TEACHERS;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = shahzad _shabbir@outlook.com;Affiliations = COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This problem arises from the lack of personalized learning sequence for learners with different knowledge level. Recommender systems play an important role in assisting the learners to find suitable learning materials and personalized learning sequence. Use of ontology for knowledge representation in knowledge-based recommender systems would facilitate sharing, reuse and common terminology. Since programming concepts have logical relationships among together so, traditional education systems are more stressful and very time-consuming. This paper aims to propose an ontology-based recommender system to present a Personalized Learning Sequence in Programming (PLSP) domain which is depended to learner's knowledge level. A recommender module and, the knowledge base module are integrated together in the proposed framework. The recommender module as the main module in the framework, has three stages which is working based on semantic rules and ontology representation. Evaluation of the system was carried out by comparing the non-recommender system (web-based search) using 32 ICT respondents.

We manipulated the modeling type, which is a CD or an ERD, and observed its impact on the type and number of errors in modeling tasks.FindingsCertain modeling aspects that are at a higher level of abstraction are much more prone to errors. Male students made more errors. There is a learning effect from one type of model to the other. Female students had much more significant learning from one model to the other.ImplicationsEducators should invest time and effort into applying modeling activities where the error rate is higher. Since female students have an advantage over male students in several modeling aspects, it is further proof that female students' lack of propensity for the STEM professions is based on a perceptual barrier regarding their ability to succeed and not on an inferiority in these domains."","""",""10.1080/08993408.2023.2220104 , EarlyAccessDate = JUN 2023"",database modeling class diagram entity-relationship diagram gender differences";Keywords-Plus = SEX-DIFFERENCES STEREOTYPES EFFICACY SUPPORT SCIENCE SKILLS WOMEN GAP;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = adis@sce.ac.il,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This approach calls for curating multimodal data from ecologically valid learning settings to train AIED systems, and maintaining flexibility in expectations around rational learner behavior when analyzing data from such systems.

This paper examines the effects of open learner modeling and its extension with social comparison features, known as open social learner modeling (OSLM), on students' knowledge monitoring abilities. We report the results of two semester-long classroom studies, using subjects who were undergraduate and graduate students in Java Programming and Database Management courses at the University of Pittsburgh. During their studies, the students were able to use different versions of an online practice system equipped with both OLM and OSLM. The students' knowledge monitoring abilities were examined in two ways: through absolute and relative assessments. According to the results, although in both OLM and OSLM groups the students' absolute knowledge monitoring ability increased during the semester-long study, relative self-assessment ability (i.e., their ability to compare their own knowledge levels with the knowledge levels of their peers) only increased in the OSLM group.

Meta-Interest, a personality-aware product recommendation system based on user interest mining and meta-path discovery, has been proposed in this study.

Fascination with English medium instruction (EMI) is fast growing in higher education institutions in non-native English-speaking countries, including Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstani government adopted a trilingual education policy in 2007 and the Bologna Process in 2010. Both these initiatives motivated universities to offer academic programmes in the English language. As a result, EMI programmes are offered in over 70 higher education institutions across Kazakhstan. In addition, there are four major Kazakhstani universities which offer academic programmes in English only. Despite the increase in the number of EMI programmes, there is a lack of empirical evidence about the difficulties and challenges faced by students in the EMI programmes. Aim. The present study aimed to investigate the nature, forms, and levels of challenges graduate students face in academic reading and writing in English and the way they cope with these challenges. The study was conducted with graduate students and faculty in 10 selected Kazaklistani universities, which offer academic programmes in EMI. Research methodology and methods. The study is based on a mixed-method design, involving an online survey and semi-structured interviews. The closed-ended questions have been analysed using SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The grounded theory analysis was utilised to scrutinise open-ended questions and interview transcripts. Results and scientific novelty. The study's results indicated two major challenges faced by graduate students in academic reading and writing: the personal-psychological challenge and sociological challenge. The first challenge includes students' previous academic backgrounds, exposure, and learning experiences. The second challenge is related to English academic culture and students' worldviews, concepts, and values about English as a language and medium of instruction. As a result, graduate students experienced a lack of vocabulary, inadequate academic literacy skills, unfamiliarity with academic writing styles in English, and lack of skills to synthesise reading materials. Practical significance. Hence, this study recommends systematising English language programmes across secondary and higher education institutions to help students acquire advanced English language proficiency. Also, the study results suggest that local faculty members should be trained according to international standards in terms of their English language skills and innovative teaching methods."","""",10.17853/1994-5639-2022-8-95-115,challenges graduate students academic reading academic writing EMI Kazakhstan";Keywords-Plus = ENGLISH-MEDIUM INSTRUCTION EDUCATION POLICY;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = afzal.min@nu.edu.kz guldana.akhmetova2@nu.edu.kz lyudmila.fillipova@tu.edu.kz duis...;Affiliations = Nazarbayev University Suleyman Demirel University - Kazakhstan,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study draws inspiration from tailored intervention research in public health and investigates the effectiveness of personality-based tailored explanations by implementing them for the recommended quizzes in an explainable recommender system. High school students (n = 217) were clustered into three distinct profiles labeled Diligent (n = 77), Fearful (n = 72), and Agreeable (n = 68), based on the Big Five personality traits. The students were divided into a tailored intervention group (n = 106) and a control group (n = 111). In the tailored intervention group, personalized explanations for recommended quizzes were provided based on student profiles, with explanations based on quiz characteristics. In the control group, only non-personalized explanations based on quiz characteristics were provided. An 18-day A/B experiment showed that the tailored intervention group had significantly higher recommendation usage than the control group.

Such systems can enhance learning by providing personalized recommendations. In Extensive Reading (ER) for English as a Foreign Language (EFL), recommending materials is crucial due to the paradox that learners with low SDL skills struggle to select suitable ER resources, despite ER's potential to improve SDL. Additionally, determining the difficulty level of ER materials and assessing learners' progress remains challenging. The system must also explain its recommendations to foster motivation and trust. This study proposes a mechanism to estimate the difficulty of ER materials, adapted to learner preferences, using information retrieval techniques, and an explainable recommendation system for English materials. An experiment was conducted with 240 Japanese junior high school students in an ER program to assess the accuracy of difficulty estimation and identify learner characteristics receptive to the recommendations. While the recommendations did not significantly impact learners' English skills or motivation, they were positively received.

To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers.

In this study, a personalized learning path for MOOCs based on long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed to meet students' personal needs for learning. According to students' video -watching behaviors, we proposed an MOOC material RS that identifies students with similar learning behaviors through clustering and then uses the clustering results and the learning paths of each group of students to construct an LSTM model to recommend learning paths. The system's learning path recommendations can effectively improve the online participation of learners, and students who received recommendations progressed from the slow -progress group to the medium -progress or fast -progress group. In addition, the learning attitude questionnaire results indicated that the proposed system not only motivated learners to continue learning and achieve high learning capacity but also supported their study planning according to their individual learning needs."","""",10.30191/ETS.202404\_27(2).SP03,MOOCs AI -based recommender system Knowledge map LSTM Individual learning";Keywords-Plus = HIGHER-EDUCATION ENGAGEMENT;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = tjw@nutc.edu.tw nfhuang@cs.nthu.edu.tw s38565@gmail.com wei84914@gmail.com ntouadd...;Affiliations = National Taichung University of Science & Technology National Tsing Hua University...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;

Consequently, online autonomous learning has garnered increasing scholarly attention. Embodying principles of openness and transcending temporal and spatial constraints, online courses afforded global learners opportunities for continued education during the pandemic. Online courses facilitate enhanced online interaction among students and teachers and allow students to control their learning experience (learner autonomy) and pace. Nevertheless, online autonomous learning presents fundamental challenges. Notably, in the absence of direct teacher and teaching assistant supervision, online autonomous learning tends to lead to lower completion rates and higher dropout rates, concerns currently under investigation by numerous researchers. In contrast to traditional teacher-centered models, online autonomous learning courses prioritize self-directed learning. Learners independently establish learning objectives and strategies commensurate with their personal learning levels to master course content. Through a series of instructional videos, in-class exercises, discussion forums, and other interactive features, an appropriate self-regulated learning mechanism was developed to guide learners toward effective autonomous learning. The exponential growth of big data in recent years has positioned artificial intelligence as focal point of inquiry across various fields. Machine learning has catalyzed substantial advancements in the field of data science. The accumulation of extensive learning generates substantial volumes of structured and unstructured data, including the personal information of learners and various learning metrics. A growing body of research advocates for the use of data analytics as a viable method to optimize online and adaptive learning processes. Learning diagnosis entail learners' self-assessment of requisite capabilities for learning tasks and comparative analyses of capabilities against domain expert-established concept structures by employing relevant question parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination. To facilitate this, an automated artificial intelligence material recommendation mechanism was developed, underpinned by several machine learning models. By observing online user learning behavior patterns, learning data and indicators were formulated, enabling the analysis of various online learning behaviors (e.g., watching videos and answering practice questions) and the generation of learning processes that can be viewed by learners. A practice question recommendation mechanism combined with an instant messaging application (LINE) was designed, leveraging teacher-created knowledge maps to assess students' mastery of concepts. Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation served as the foundational framework for the recommendation mechanism. A quasiexperimental research design was employed. Participants were recruited from a calculus course taught at a university in northern Taiwan. An experimental group used reinforcement learning - recommended practice questions for self-evaluation, and a control group received randomly assigned questions. Significant improvements in scores were observed in the experimental group, and greater learning stickiness was observed compared with the control group. Consistent percentile rank increases following practice question completion suggest the system's capacity to deliver personalized recommendations on the basis of individual differences, thereby facilitating concept-specific feedback and adaptive learning. This, in turn, fostered increased teacher-student interaction, mitigated learner isolation, and increased learning motivation, thereby strengthening self-regulated learning abilities. Upon course completion, the participants could autonomously generate artificial intelligence learning portfolios through the system on the basis of diagnostic results, creating a comprehensive record of their learning performance. These portfolios facilitated the elucidation of learner mastery levels through the accumulation of extensive learning data (big data) on the platform. A postcourse self-regulated learning questionnaire survey revealed a positive participant perception of the materialrecommendation mechanism and generated artificial intelligence learning portfolio. The participants demonstrated strong positive attitudes toward system reliability, learning attitudes, and metacognition but low perceptions of system utility, and low overall usage rates. Enhancing usage incentive, continuously refining the accuracy of the recommendation system's algorithms, and conducting comparative analyses with existing systems are essential to improve the recommendation system's perceived utility."","""",10.6209/JORIES.202409\_69(3).0003,AI learning portfolio self-regulated learning reinforcement learning educational big data learnin...";Keywords-Plus = STUDENTS PERFORMANCE;Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = tchuang@nutc.edu.tw;Affiliations = National Taichung University of Science & Technology National Taichung University ...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge, and the most popular type of integrated knowledge is a list of relevant concepts mentioned in the textbooks. With these concepts, multiple intelligent operations, such as content linking, content recommendation, or student modeling, can be performed. However, existing automatic keyphrase extraction methods, even supervised ones, cannot deliver sufficient accuracy to be practically useful in this task. Manual annotation by experts has been demonstrated to be a preferred approach for producing high-quality labeled data for training supervised models. However, most researchers in the education domain still consider the concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than a carefully executed task, which can result in low-quality annotated data. Using the annotation of concepts for the Introduction to Information Retrieval textbook as a case study, this paper presents a knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations. As demonstrated by the data we collected, the inter-annotator agreement gradually increased along with our procedure, and the concept annotations we produced led to better results in document linking and student modeling tasks. The contributions of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a codebook for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations for the target textbook, which could be used as a gold standard in further intelligent textbook research."","""",""10.1007/s10758-021-09544-z , EarlyAccessDate = JUL 2021"",Knowledge engineering Concept annotation Concept mining Annotation scheme Intelligent textbook El...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = mew133@pitt.edu hkc6@pitt.edu k.thaker@pitt.edu peterb@pitt.edu dah44@pitt.edu;Affiliations = Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE) University of Pittsburgh,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, the audio signals were converted into mel spectrograms, and accordingly, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features of audio learning resources were obtained. Then, on the basis of the conventional content-based audio recommendation algorithm, the established interest degree vector of target students with respect to music learning was expanded, and a collaborative filtering hybrid algorithm for audio learning resources that incorporates the interest degrees of neighbouring students was proposed, which effectively improved the accuracy and stability in the prediction of students' interest in music learning.

The deep neural networks (DNN)-inspired cognitive state prediction method improved prediction performance significantly";" however, the lack of explainability with DNNs and the unitary scoring approach fail to reveal the factors influencing human learning. Identifying and understanding these factors remain a challenge. Thus, this article proposes the temporal fuzzy cognitive map (tFCM) model, which combines the prediction power of DNNs with the interpretability of fuzzy cognitive maps. In the proposed tFCM model, cognitive states are modeled as fuzzy, multidimensional, and interrelated vectors, which are input to a long short-term memory network for prediction. This integration allows the proposed model to combine the exceptional ability of DNNs to uncover latent factors with the distinct benefits of fuzzy cognitive maps' ability to reveal potential correlations. A comparative experiment was designed and conducted on a large-scale dataset to assess the predictive performance and interpretability of the proposed tFCM model. The results demonstrate tFCM's superior performance and interpretability compared to existing models.

However, fine-grained topic identification and evolution analysis in this field remain underexplored. This study identifies key research topics and tracks their development to uncover AI's trajectory in library information services. Leveraging deep learning-based topic modeling techniques-BERTopic and Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM)-we analyzed 2,789 filtered article abstracts retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases published between 2015 and 2024. The modeling process involved several steps: we first generated document embeddings using Sentence-BERT, followed by dimensionality reduction with UMAP to project the high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional space. We then applied HDBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, to group semantically similar documents. Topic representations were constructed using class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) to identify the most representative keywords for each cluster. Finally, we employed DTM to examine the temporal evolution of these topics over the 2015-2024 period. The study identified 27 topics, including OCR for historical documents, multilingual processing, book recommendation systems, author name disambiguation, and misinformation detection, among others. These were further categorized into ten research directions, such as digital transformation, information retrieval, and scholarly communication. Temporal analysis revealed emerging AI-driven trends alongside steady growth in traditional areas like information literacy education. Findings highlight the growing integration of AI technologies into library information services.

To address these problems, we propose a theory blended semi-supervised learning method to implement a SRL recommender system. Specifically, we developed a fully-supervised machine learning recommender and a semi-supervised machine learning recommender to provide relevant suggestions for enhancing student SRL skills. In the first phase of our study, we investigated whether a semi-supervised algorithm could predict students' SRL more effectively than a fully supervised algorithm. In the second phase, we developed two recommender systems, one based on the semi-supervised algorithm and the other on the fully supervised one, to provide relevant recommendations for enhancing student SRL skills. We conducted an experiment involving two distinct groups of online students who received SRL suggestions from the respective recommenders. Our results showed that the semi-supervised learning recommender significantly enhanced students' SRL compared to the fully-supervised one, with a large effect size (F(1, 81) = 12.879, partial eta 2 = 0.14). This research offers insights for enhancing SRL recommender systems and serves as a practical guide for future studies."","""",""10.1007/s10639-024-13111-1 , EarlyAccessDate = OCT 2024"",Self-regulated learning Semi-supervised learning Supervised learning Recommender systems Online l...";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = kfhew@hku.hk;Affiliations = University of Hong Kong,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, these data tend to be highly sparse (80\%similar to 90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict learners' future performance and explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learning performance data to address data sparsity. First, learning performance data can be represented as a 3-D tensor with dimensions corresponding to learners, questions, and attempts, effectively capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing (KT) tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, data augmentation using generative artificial intelligence models, including generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically vanilla GANs and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance. We tested this systemic framework on adult literacy datasets from AutoTutor lessons developed for adult reading comprehension. We found that tensor factorization outperformed baseline KT techniques in tracing and predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation, and the vanilla GAN-based augmentation demonstrated greater overall stability across varying sample sizes, whereas GPT-4o-based augmentation exhibited higher variability, with occasional cases showing closer fidelity to the original data distribution. This framework facilitates the effective augmentation of learning performance data, enabling controlled, cost-effective approach for the evaluation and optimization of ITS instructional designs in both online and offline environments prior to deployment, and supporting advanced educational data mining and learning analytics."","""",10.1109/TLT.2025.3526582,Data augmentation data sparsity generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) intelligent tutoring s...";Keywords-Plus = FRAMEWORK;Research-Areas = Computer Science Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Computer Science;Interdisciplinary Applications Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = lzhang13@memphis.edu jionghao@hku.hk jpsbtini@memphis.edu cborcher@cs.cmu.edu weit...;Affiliations = University of Memphis University of Hong Kong Carnegie Mellon University Monash Un...,,;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In simple words, teaching management for the purpose of the management of teaching work is an essential content of school management, as well as a basic activity of school leaders. Therefore, more than just the basis and guarantee for the normal operation of school teaching, teaching management course plays a critical role in teacher growth and education reform, has great significance for schools. However, problems in current teaching management courses, such as lack of teacher-student interaction, single teaching content, and simple teaching methods have hindered students to develop interest in learning, and impede teachers to give full play to their educational personality. In this paper, a new collaborative knowledge construction teaching approach was applied in mobile Internet technology environment, and a blended teaching model of students' online autonomous collaborative learning before class, knowledge internalization in class, and leak filling after class was proposed. At the same time, the personalized recommendation technology based on collaborative filtering algorithm was applied. Firstly, mobile terminal core information was collected from the mobile Internet learning platform for preprocessing, and then the processed data were identified by the collaborative filtering algorithm to recognize the intrusion data, thereby realizing the quick screening and accurate pushing of learning resources. It was found from the teaching practice that this model can effectively enhance students' interest in learning, improve learning effects and independent innovation capabilities."","""",10.3991/ijet.v16i12.23323,Mobile internet teaching management collaborative knowledge filtering algorithm";Research-Areas = Education & Educational Research;Web-of-Science-Categories = Education & Educational Research;Author-Email = zhangsheng2025@163.com;Number-of-Cited-References = 13;Times-Cited = 2;Usage-Count-Last-180-days = 3;Usage-Count-Since-2013 = 16;Journal-ISO = Int.

In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 351 million learning activities from 0.8 million unique learners enrolled in over 1.6 thousand courses within two years. Specifically, we mine and identify the learning patterns of the crowd from both temporal and course enrollment perspectives leveraging mutual information theory and sequential pattern mining methods. From the temporal perspective, we find that the time intervals between consecutive learning activities of learners exhibit a mix of power-law and periodic cosine function distribution. By qualifying the relationship between course pairs, we observe that the most frequently co-enrolled courses usually fall in the same category or the same university. We demonstrate these findings can facilitate manifold applications including recommendation tasks on courses.
