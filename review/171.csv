1;Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Comprehensive Review;"As education constitutes an essential development standard for individuals and societies, researchers have been exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain and have embedded the technology within it through a myriad of applications. In order to provide a detailed overview of the efforts, this article pays particular attention to these developments by highlighting key application areas of data-driven AI in education; it also analyzes existing tools, research trends, as well as limitations of the role data-driven AI can play in education. In particular, this article reviews various applications of AI in education including student grading and assessments, student retention and drop-out predictions, sentiment analysis, intelligent tutoring, classroom monitoring, and recommender systems. This article also provides a detailed bibliometric analysis to highlight the salient research trends in AI in education over nine years (2014-2022) and further provides a detailed description of the tools and platforms developed as the outcome of research and development efforts in AI in education. For the bibliometric analysis, articles from several top venues are analyzed to explore research trends in the domain. The analysis shows sufficient contribution in the domain from different parts of the world with a clear lead for the United States. Moreover, students' grading and evaluation have been observed as the most widely explored application. Despite the significant success, we observed several aspects of education where AI alone has not contributed much. We believe such detailed analysis is expected to provide a baseline for future research in the domain."
2;A novel recommendation of learning items based on deep neural networks and trust relationships;With the rapid development of information technologies, online learning platforms have become the most convenient way for users(teachers and learners) to share their learning content. However, due to the increasing number of educational content, it becomes very difficult for learners to find the most appropriate items. Most previous methods focused on users' ratings to establish learner's profiles, while recent work has added users' comments. In this work we are interested on the usage of social learning networks and we propose a novel learning items recommendation approach through sentiment analysis. Two different deep neural network models (DNNs) have been used, namely: bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with their modified version, long short-term memory (LSTM). These models are based on the learners' data, including their favourite content and comments. To support learners in selecting learning resources, a list of trusted learners was developed using similarity between learners. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, experiments have been conducted on two different datasets. The results we have obtained demonstrated that our approach outperforms the baselines and related work.
3;Enriching the learner's model through the semantic analysis of learning traces;Our aim in this paper is to improve the efficiency of a learning process by using learners' traces to detect particular needs. The analysis of the semantic path of a learner or group of learners during the learning process can allow detecting those students who are in needs of help as well as identify the insufficiently mastered concepts. We examine the possibility of using a student's browsing path during a learning session, based on his navigation traces, to update the learner model. We assume that the domain concepts examined outside the learning platform but that are related to the course concepts are problematic to the learner. Knowing about these concepts may allow the course's author to adapt the course to the learner's needs regarding these concepts, as well as allow the tutor to help and assist the learner on these problematic concepts. We rely on Web data mining methods to filter, organize, and analyze the student's browsing path. More precisely, we use a domain ontology of the course and the similarities that exist between external documents (visited pages) and the domain concepts (the course keywords). This analysis process makes it possible to detect students' learning difficulties and to adapt the course based on the learner's model.
4;A novel Based-Approach Composed of Clustering Algorithm \& Cosine Similarity for Products Recommendation;"There are huge tons of transactions being accomplished online every day. This implies that e-commerce is facing the problem of data and information overloads. While customers are shopping via websites, they spend a lot of time to search for the required products based on their needs. This problem can easily be alleviated by having an accurate recommendation system based on a strong algorithm and confident measures in this regard. There are two main techniques for products recommendation; content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. If one of these two techniques implemented on the e-commerce system, a lot of limitations and weak points will appear. This paper aims at generating an optimal list of product, which, in turn, generates an accurate and reliable list of items. The new approach is composed of three components; clustering algorithm, user-based collaborative filtering, and the Cosine similarity measure. This approach implemented using a real dataset of past experienced users. The accuracy of the search results is a matter to users, it recommends the most appropriate products to users of the e-commerce website. This approach shows trustworthy results and achieved a high level of accuracy for recommending products to users."
5;Matching Authors and Reviewers in Peer Assessment Based on Authors' Profiles;Aim/Purpose To encourage students' engagement in peer assessments and provide students with better-quality feedback, this paper describes a technique for author -re-viewer matching in peer assessment systems - a Balanced Allocation algorithm.Background Peer assessment concerns evaluating the work of colleagues and providing feed-back on their work. This process is widely applied as a learning method to in-volve students in the progress of their learning. However, as students have dif-ferent ability levels, the efficacy of the peer feedback differs from case to case. Thus, peer assessment may not provide satisfactory results for students. In or-der to mitigate this issue, this paper explains and evaluates an algorithm that matches the author to a set of reviewers. The technique matches authors and re-viewers based on how difficult the authors perceived the assignment to be, and the algorithm then matches the selected author to a group of reviewers who may meet the author's needs in regard to the selected assignment.Methodology This study used the Multiple Criteria Decision-Making methodology (MCDM) to determine a set of reviewers from among the many available options. The weighted sum method was used because the data that have been collected in user profiles are expressed in the same unit. This study produced an experi-mental result, examining the algorithm with a real collected dataset and mock- up dataset. In total, there were 240 students in the real dataset, and it contained self-assessment scores, peer scores, and instructor scores for the same assign-ment. The mock-up dataset created 1000 records for self-assessment scores. The algorithm was evaluated using focus group discussions with 29 program-ming students and interviews with seven programming instructors. Contribution This paper contributes to the field in the following two ways. First, an algorithm using a MCDM methodology was proposed to match authors and reviewers in order to facilitate the peer assessment process. In addition, the algorithm used self-assessment as an initial data source to match users, rather than randomly creating reviewer - author pairs.Findings The findings show the accurate results of the algorithm in matching three re-viewers for each author. Furthermore, the algorithm was evaluated based on students' and instructors' perspectives. The results are very promising, as they depict a high level of satisfaction for the Balanced Allocation algorithm. Recommendations for PractitionersRecommendations for Researchers We recommend instructors to consider using the Balanced Allocation algorithm to match students in peer assessments, and consequently to benefit from per-sonalizing peer assessment based on students' needs. Several MCDM methods could be expanded upon, such as the analytic hierar-chy process (AHP) if different attributes are collected, or the artificial neural network (ANN) if fuzzy data is available in the user profile. Each method is suitable for special cases depending on the data available for decision-making.Impact on Society Suitable pairing in peer assessment would increase the credibility of the peer as-sessment process and encourage students' engagement in peer assessments.Future Research The Balanced Allocation algorithm could be applied using a single group, and a peer assessment with random matching with another group may also be con-ducted, followed by performing a t-test to determine the impact of matching on students' performances in the peer assessment activity.
6;Investigating Students' Performance and Motivation in Computer Programming through a Gamified Recommender System;In this study, a personalized gamified recommender system was developed to help secondary-school students in Saudi Arabia learn computer programming. This recommender system supports those students by providing personalized recommendations to address their weaknesses and increase their motivation toward computer programming. A total of 60 female secondary-school students participated in this empirical study and were divided in to an intervention and comparison group. Due to the distance learning directives imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole study was conducted online. Data were collected through a post-test to measure student performance. In addition, a learning motivation questionnaire was distributed to all the study participants to measure their motivation toward learning programming. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey questionnaire was distributed to the experimental group to measure their level of motivation after using the recommender system. The results showed that the personalized gamified recommender system positively affected the students' performance in the intervention group and enhanced their motivation toward learning computer programming.
7;Primary School Teachers Adaptation towards 'Madrasati' E-learning Platform during Covid-19 Crisis;This study aims to reveal the most notable obstacles that primary school teachers face in using the educational platform MADRASATI during the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. A descriptive survey with a questionnaire tool was employed, and there were 20 questions on the potential obstacles. The randomized sample comprised 390 teachers in state primary schools in Riyadh City (from 22,458 teachers in total). The results revealed that the main obstacles were ``difficulty in applying the educational platform to primary beginner students '' and ``overcrowded virtual classes [ which] do not allow the use of the platform MADRASATI. '' However, the teachers ranked responses such as ``the students' abstention from dealing with new types of education '' lowest, with only an average degree of agreement on whether this was a notable obstacle. The study also revealed statistically significant differences in the obstacles to using MADRASATI, with male teachers in the sample more likely to use the platform. However, other variables such as educational qualification and pedagogical experience were not associated with any statistically significant differences in obstacles the teachers faced.
8;Using Recommender Systems for Matching Students with Suitable Specialization: An Exploratory Study at King Abdulaziz University;In Saudi Arabia, all high school graduates who want join local universities have to go through a preparatory year before selecting their specific specialization/major. One of the most concerning issues for those fresh undergraduate college students is the selection of their specialization. College specialization selection is critical for them, as their academic and career future will be affected by this decision. An unsuitable specialization selection will have unfortunate consequences, not only on the students' future but also on the university's resources and budget. This paper suggests a solution to this problem by introducing a preliminary study of a recommender system (RS), which will recommend the appropriate specialization for the students based on various tests and grades during the preparatory year at King Abdulaziz University (KAU). The proposed system guides students through their specialization selection process based on their abilities. The collaborative filtering technique was used to build the RS and K-fold cross-validation was adopted to evaluate its accuracy and performance. The results showed the prediction of a specialization for each student with good accuracy ratio. These promising initial results provide a feasible solution to assess this issue further in future studies.
9;Recommender Systems for E-Learning;The recommender systems are really important in this phase because the users want to be concentrated and to be focused on the domain in which they are interested. There should be minimal deviation in the topics suggested by the recommendation engines. Some of the famous e-learning platforms suggest recommendations based on tags such as highest rated, bestsellers, and so on in various domains. This ultimately makes the users deviate from the domain in which they have to master, and it results in not satisfying the user needs. So, to address this problem, effective recommendation engines will help provide recommendations according to the users by implementing the machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering and content-based techniques. In this chapter, the authors discuss the recommendation systems, types of recommendation systems, and challenges.
10;Learning beyond books: A hybrid model to learn real-world problems;There are several initiatives underway to improve the learning of software developers. These attempts include the integration of GitHub into software engineering classes, the creation of learning management systems, gamification approaches, and collaborative learning platforms. These initiatives have demonstrated promise in boosting students' collaborative growth and cooperation abilities, emphasizing their potential influence on improving learning experiences in practical areas. Books, on the other hand, remain basic in education, but their physical size limits their ability to explore all practical elements of a topic in depth. This limitation requires more research and application of theoretical information in real-world circumstances. In this work, we address the issue of limited space in traditional books that frequently prevents complete presentation of practical elements of a topic. To address this issue, we propose an application that improves the reading experience and accelerates the learning process. To anticipate themes, we use a combination of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithms and a generative pre-trained transformer. First, utilizing LDA to find potential topic keywords inside the text and then leveraging generative pretrained transformer to predict topic names based on the LDA produced keywords. In addition, a query builder module produces and executes queries depending on the current page's topic, obtaining real-world issues from Stack Overflow. The system classifies results by query-title similarity, question-answer ranking, and content quality before displaying them to users. This bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. We illustrate the usefulness of suggested tool using simulations, comparison with existing tools and user studies. The majority of users provide favorable comments and find it interesting and helpful for improving the learning process.
11;Video-Based Learning Recommender Systems: A Systematic Literature Review;"Recently, using videos as a learning resource has received a lot of attention and turned widely exploited as an effective learning tool. With the rapid spread of instructional videos, the number of these tools in all disciplines is becoming very high. It is fractious for learners to find video courses adapted to their needs. Recommender system is an important tool; it can help learners for better navigation and better guidance to access and reach information and interesting videos content and restrict the number of choices provided. This article presents results of a systematic literature review on video-based learning recommender systems. This systematic literature review included the papers indexed in five scientific digital libraries and published between 2009 and 2023. Our review focuses on examining both the technical and pedagogical aspects of video-based learning recommender systems. In terms of technical aspects, we analyze the most commonly used recommendation approaches in video-based learning, as well as additional methods and techniques employed to enhance the effectiveness of video-based learning recommendations. We also explore the variables and data sources that have been investigated in the process of recommending videos for learning purposes, along with the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of these systems. Regarding the pedagogical aspects, we investigate the learning environments where these systems have been implemented, the subjects and educational programs that hold primary importance in video-based learning recommendations, and the overall learning process."
12;Recommender System Techniques and Approaches to Improve the Modern Learning Challenges;Recommendation systems have been developed from the web. These recommendation systems are useful in collecting information from an available set of sources for a user's preferences. The information can be acquired from user's collection of details to share, to review, to do positive ratings by monitoring the user's behavior to improve the quality of top `N' recommendations. Now if we come to modern learning system, it has good framework to influence the training factors from the data, triggers, and learner's preferences. Modern learning can be compared to online learning which carries to the future needs. Modern learning can be instituted in schools, engineering colleges, and working campus. The modern learning system combines interrelated data, processes, and resources to create a system of interdependencies that work together, adapting to changing business needs. These interdependencies include multi-level dynamics driven by the organization, training professionals, technological advances, and the learners themselves.
13;Learning actor ontology for a personalised recommendation in massive open online courses;Massive Open Online Courses revolutionised online learning and instigated research on information and communication technologies for learning to enhance the learner experience and increase his engagement level. In earlier research, we identified the recommendation criteria that could be used to recommend suitable MOOCs for the learner's needs and motivations. Thus, criteria like the level of knowledge, competences and the pace of learning introduced by MOOCs and preferred by learners will be matched by a personalised recommender system. In this paper, we model the Learning Actor ontology to be used for this matching process. It is a domain ontology that was developed by following the phases of the on-to-knowledge methodology: feasibility study, kickoff phase, refinement phase, evaluation and validation phase and, finally, the maintenance phase. At last, we obtained the learning ontology that describes the ``learning actor '' major class by using a complex definition of characteristics and their relationship and range of values.
14;Implementation of a Machine Learning-Based MOOC Recommender System Using Learner Motivation Prediction;phenomenon of high dropout rates has been the concern of MOOC providers and educators since the emergence of this disruptive technology in online learning. This led to the focus on learner motivation studies from different aspects like demotivation signs detection, learning path personalization and course recommendation. Our paper aims to predict learner motivation for MOOCs to select the right MOOC for the right learner. Accordingly, we predict the motivation in an educational data mining approach by extracting and preprocessing learners' navigation traces on a MOOC platform, and building a Machine Learning model that predicts accurately a given learner's motivation for a MOOC. The comparison of the performance of four supervised learning algorithms resulted in the selection of the Random Forest classifier as the best modeling technique for motivation prediction with an accuracy of 95\%. Afterward, we test the Machine Learning-based recommendation function for learners of the MOOC platform dataset to recommend the Top-10 MOOCs suitable for the target learner. Finally, further research on learner characteristics considered in recommender systems could enlarge the recommendation scope of MOOCs and maintain learner motivation.
15;Tracking English language learners' progress through a gamified social visualisation tool to increase motivation and performance;"Students need to monitor their progress constantly to improve their performance, and with large classes at university level education, both online and offline, most instructors are not able to provide individual students with progress reports other than separate assignments or exam results. Some e-learning systems track students' progress; however, these traditional personalised e-learning systems hide students' data; thus, students are not provided with the full picture of their progress and are unable to position themselves among their peers. This research aims to introduce a way to track English language learners' progress through an interactive gamified social visualisation tool in the form of a car race game without jeopardising student privacy or hiding crucial progress information. The results of this study showed that social comparison of students' progress and the gamification aspects of the tool made students more engaged and motivated to win the race, which affected their academic performance positively."
16;The Effect of Critical Reading Skills on the Evaluation Skills of the Creative Reading Process;"Purpose: To raise authentically creative individuals, it is compulsory to employ contemporary reading methods. Although critical reading, which is the main medium for accessing the right knowledge, is defined as a sub-category for creative reading in which high cognitive processes are involved, the connection between these has not been clearly put forward. This study aimed at examining the effect of critical reading skills of 5th grade learners on their evaluation skills of creative reading process, and the role of gender in this effect through structural equation modelling. Research Methods: The study was supported by relational screening model. The study group was formed by simple random sampling and composed of 265 5th grade learners. The data were collected through the Scale for the Evaluation of Creative Reading Process and the Critical Reading Scale. SPSS 23, AMOS 22.0, and structural equation modeling were utilized for data analysis. Maximum Likelihood method was selected in the estimation of parameters related to models which were formed for examining the effect of critical reading skills on the evaluation of creative reading process and the role of gender. To this end, fit indices (chi(2)/df, CFI, GFI, TLI, NFI, IFI, RMSEA, and SRMR) were used. Findings: The study demonstrated that all hypotheses models were valid; critical reading skills explained the evaluation skills of creative reading process by 57\%, and that they had a direct and strong impact on the evaluation skills of the critical reading process. In the female-learner model, critical reading skills affected the evaluation skills by 43\%, whereas the male-learner model explained this effect by 67\%. In addition, both models bear a direct and strong impact. Implications for Research and Practice: The results of the study reveal that critical reading skill is a significant predictor for the evaluation of the creative reading process. It can be stated that the evaluation skills of the creative reading process may improve in conjunction with the development of critical reading skills. (C) 2020 Ani Publishing Ltd.

17;Building the Future of Education with Learning Analytics, Personalization and Collaboration An Interview with Dr Elvira Popescu;Embracing the future of education involves harnessing the power of learning analytics, personalization, and collaboration. Learning analytics enables educators to glean valuable insights from student data, tailors learning experiences to individual needs, and fosters interactive learning environments. Dr. Elvira Popescu is a distinguished Full Professor at the Computers and Information Technology Department, University of Craiova, Romania. Her extensive research portfolio encompasses technology- enhanced learning, adaptive educational systems, learner modeling, computer-supported collaborative learning, learning analytics, and intelligent and distributed computing.
18;Concept Maps and Open Learner Models in a Computer Networking Course;"Contribution: We explored the effects of using concept maps for the instruction of a college-level telecommunications course, as both the ``backbone '' structure of the traditional lectures and a navigational support feature within an online independent practice support system, on students' final learning gains and engagement with the learning content Background: The usage of concept maps as an instructional aid has proved beneficial across a range of disciplines; however, studies that support this in a computer science education context and by combining holistic data coming from both online activity logs and the physical classroom are scarce Research Question: How do students use concept maps to support their learning in a Telecommunications class and how do usage patterns correlate with their final learning and their perception of the usefulness of this educational tool? Methodology: We ran a three-year classroom experiment where we collected data from 1) interactions with the online concept map system and 2) their perceptions of the concept maps' usefulness and understandability. Regarding the experiment design, during lectures, the instructor used concept maps to highlight course concepts and their relationships. In the independent practice context, interactive concept maps helped students choose relevant practice content to work on and served as an OLM to visualize individual-and class-level progress in mastering course concepts Findings: We found that having access to concept maps that present a holistic view of course concepts in both study contexts improved students' ability to answer questions that required the application of conceptual knowledge. We also found that the use of the concept map system was correlated with an increase in students' positive perceptions of the usefulness of the intervention, both at a lecture level and at a practice level, but also with their actual engagement with working with the educational content offered by the learning platform."
19;Advances in personalised recommendation of learning objects based on the set covering problem using ontology;Loop-based intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) support the learning process using a step-by-step problem-solving approach. A limitation of ITSs is that few contents are compatible with this approach. On the other hand, recommendation systems can recommend different types of content but ignore the fine-grained concepts typical of the step-by-step approach. This work contributes to the solution of this state-of-the-art challenge by proposing an approach for the recommendation of learning objects from different areas of knowledge, considering the refined concepts of ITSs. To deal with this challenge, we formulate the learning object recommendation problem as the set covering problem that belongs to the NP-hard class problems. An exact algorithm and a greedy heuristic were properly adapted, resulting in a promising approach to solve these problems, as shown by the results. This resulted in more personalised content for students using collaborative filtering and an ontology that models their knowledge, learning styles and search parameters.
20;Intelligent Chatbot-LDA Recommender System;With the proliferation of distance platforms, in particular that of an open access such as Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC), the learner finds himself overwhelmed with data which are not all efficient for his interest. Besides, the MOOC has tools that allow learners to seek information, express their ideas, and participate in discussions in an online forum. This tool is a huge repository of rich data, which continues to evolve, however its exploitation is fiddly in the search for information relevant to the learner. Similarly, the task of the tutor seems to be difficult in management of a large number of learners. To this end, the development of a Chatbot able to meet the requests of learners in a natural language is necessary to the deroulement a course in the MOOC. The ChatBot plays the role of assistant and guide for the learners and for the tutors. However, ChatBot responses come from a knowledge base, which must be relevant. Knowledge extraction to answer questions is a difficult task due to the number of MOOC participants. Learners' interactions with the MOOC platform generate massive information, particularly in discussion forums by seeking answers to their questions. Identifying and extracting knowledge from online forums requires collaborative interactions between learners. In this article we propose a new approach to answer learners' questions in a relevant and instantaneous way in a ChatBot in natural language. Our model is based on the LDA Bayesian statistical method, applied to threads posted in the forum and classifies them to provide the learner with a rich semantic response. These threads taken from the discussion forum in the form of knowledge will enrich the ChatBot knowledge database. In parallel, we will map the extracted knowledge to ontology, to provide the learner with pedagogical resources that will serve as learning support.
21;Adaptive Help System Based on Learners `Digital Traces' and Learning Styles;Learning management system (LMS) such as Claroline, Ganesha, Chamilo, Moodie, are commonly and well used in e-education (e-learning). Most of theTechnology Enhanced Learning (TEL) focus on supporting teachers in the creation and organization of online courses. However, in general, they do not consider individual differences of each learner. In addition, they do not provide enough indicators which will help to track the learners. In this paper, we investigate the benefits of integrating learning styles in the Web-based educational systems. Also, we are interested in the use of interaction traces in order to address the lack of feedback between the learner and the teacher. Generally, we aim to offer a tool that allows the tutor and the instructional designer to interpret learner courses, in order to provide help as needed for each individual.
22;Investigating the Use of Deep Learning and Implicit Feedback in K12 Educational Recommender Systems;Recommender systems are increasingly being used in university or online education. However, recommender systems still have not found major usage in K12 education. This may be because of the unique challenges that recommender systems face when used by a young and diverse population. However, recommender systems for K12 education could provide many benefits for students and teachers, such as the simplification of personalized learning. Some of the issues with K12 educational recommender systems may be solved by the use of deep learning and implicit feedback. As such, we investigated the use of deep recommendation algorithms and implicit feedback for K12 educational recommender systems. To do this, we compared metrics for highly cited traditional and deep recommendation algorithms trained on explicit and implicit data. We found that recommendation algorithms using deep learning as a group do not differ in performance compared to traditional recommendation algorithms. We also found that the use of implicit feedback led to higher performance than using explicit feedback. The best performing algorithm used both deep learning and implicit feedback. We conclude that deep learning can be a benefit for K12 recommender systems, particularly when the ordered sequence of items is carefully accounted for. We also conclude that researchers and developers must carefully consider which feedback contributes the most information for learning.
23;Personalization of serious games for learning;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present principles for personalization of both learning content and gameplay in serious games for learning, which are based on a combined model of the student that comprises user, learner and player-related aspects of the student's profile. Each of the considered user, learner and player sub-models has a static and dynamic group of characteristics. These characteristics assist general approaches for learning mazes game personalization applied to embedded mini-games (designed as information units, learning objects and educational tasks) so that to be adjustable and to enable learners to acquire knowledge more effectively. Design/methodology/approach A student modelling approach was applied to design the personalization of learning content in the educational maze game and each of them contained mini-games. To evaluate the student's preferences about the types of mini-games and ways of their personalization depending on individual and group student characteristics, the authors conducted an online survey. Findings This study presents examples of personalization of four types of mini-games available in maze halls, namely, question, searching, arranging and action games. Next, the research discusses findings from an online survey aiming at the evaluation of the preferred types of mini-games and the way of their personalization. There are analysed results concerning the impact of the student model characteristics on the preferred ways of personalization in educational maze games, together with criteria for personalization of educational resources according to student's level of knowledge, age, goals and learning style. Research limitations/implications A significant limitation of the research is the relatively small number of survey participants and the lack of studying the impact of learning and playing styles over game personalization. Another limitation of the study is the inclusion of only some of the mini-games within the demonstration maze, which respondents play before answering the survey questions. Originality/value This paper presents original research on the personalization of educational maze game based on a model of the student profile that comprises both static and dynamic properties reflecting user, learner and player-related aspects of the student character, together with results obtained from an online survey.
24;Context-aware recommender system for adaptive ubiquitous learning;The use of context-aware recommender systems for adaptive ubiquitous learning has become a promising and interesting research direction in recent years, both as a result of the vast use of ubiquitous devices in our day-to-day lives and because of students' increasing desire to learn with ease anytime and anywhere without restriction. This paper implements an RFID-based context-aware technology and recommender system for adaptive ubiquitous learning that will help learners to achieve personalised learning goals and greater learning efficiency. Our context-aware recommender suggests courseware to students based on their location, surrounding noise level and time of day. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology was used to acquire context awareness, and fuzzy logic was employed to develop courseware recommendations. The front end of the system was developed using Android Studio. Experimental results were obtained from selected students from different disciplines who evaluated the system.
25;An Intelligent Recommender System for Personalized Test Administration Scheduling With Computerized Formative Assessments;The introduction of computerized formative assessments in schools has enabled the monitoring of students' progress with more flexible test schedules. Currently, the timing and frequency of computerized formative assessments are determined based on districts and school authorities' agreements with testing organizations, the teachers' judgment of students' progress, and grade-level testing guidelines recommended by researchers. However, these practices often result in a rigid test scheduling that disregards the pace at which students acquire knowledge. Furthermore, students are likely to experience the loss of instructional time due to frequent testing. To administer computerized formative assessments efficiently, teachers should be provided systematic guidance on finding an optimal testing schedule based on each student's progress. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the utility of intelligent recommender systems (IRSs) for generating individualized test schedules for students. Using real data from a large sample of students in grade 2 (n = 355,078) and grade 4 (n = 390,336) who completed the Star Math assessment during the 2017-2018 school year, we developed an IRS and evaluated its performance in finding a balance between data quality and testing frequency. Results indicated that the IRS was able to recommend a fewer number of test administrations for both grade levels, compared with standard practice. Further, the IRS was able to maximize the score difference from one test administration to another by eliminating the test administrations in which students' scores did not change significantly. Implications for generating personalized schedules to monitor student progress and recommendations for future research are discussed.
26;Modified recommender system model for the utilized eLearning platform;The recommender system has been designed to impose a degree of order into the content management of e-courses accompanying subjects on geography, history and culture of English-speaking countries within the Management of Tourism bachelor study programme. The article discusses blended learning form of education with a focus on an innovative approach to content creation and a recommender system of learning material in e-courses. These two interconnected parts of e-courses are analysed on both a theoretical and practical basis resulting in the design of a recommender system model reflecting technical specifications of established learning management system at the university. The effort of educators to enhance students' learning performance is run via active involvement of students into the process of education by means of creation, presentation and evaluation of study materials. This approach is based on elaborated guiding in the virtual space, in utilizing proper tools for communication, navigation and evaluation of students' presentations. The evaluation of students' presentations is made in the virtual space and also during face-to-face classes, for it is the inseparable part of the recommender system and as a whole corresponds to the blended learning concept. The pilot stage of implementation of the recommender system was tested during the last academic year. Students welcomed the new approach, earlier some students felt limited by time and others by lack of knowledge to evaluate which material is worth studying. Appropriateness of the model was demonstrated by reduced failure rate at the final tests.
27;Prerequisites-based course recommendation: recommending learning objects using concept prerequisites and metadata matching;"The recommendation is an active area of scientific research; it is also a challenging and fundamental problem in online education. However, classical recommender systems usually suffer from item cold-start issues. Besides, unlike other fields like e-commerce or entertainment, e-learning recommendations must ensure that learners have the adequate background knowledge to cognitively receive the recommended learning objects. For that reason, when designing an efficient e-learning recommendation method, these challenges should be considered. To address those issues, in this paper, we first propose extracting pairs concept prerequisites using Linked Open Data (LOD). Then, we evaluate the proposed list of prerequisite relationships using machine learning predictive models. Then, we present the recommendation approach based on matching concept's prerequisites relation and courses metadata through a similarity score. The experimental result of prerequisite identification was evaluated using four well-known machine learning algorithms while achieving an accuracy of 90\%. Moreover, using three known evaluation metrics, the final prerequisite-based recommendation demonstrates very good results (NDCG@10 = 86\%). This solution will enhance recommendations on online learning platforms. Additionally, it will overcome the cold-start issue and accomplish the needed prerequisites and background knowledge for learners to attain their learning objectives."
28;The Educational Recommendation System with Artificial Intelligence Chatbot: A Case Study in Thailand;The educational recommendation system with an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot is a sys - tem designed to operate on smartphones and is intended for use at the College of Industrial Technology in Thailand. Compatible with both iOS and Android operating systems, the edu - cational recommendation system in this research is capable of providing educational rec - ommendations and valuable information about the engineering degree program. It includes information about the Electronics Engineering Technology Department, relevant bodies of knowledge that can enhance awareness and public relations, and a proactive introduction to information. The main objectives of this study are to develop the capacity to analyze edu - cational issues and provide useful and accurate information for educational recommenda - tions, as well as to explore the possibilities for enhancing this system. The results of the study address the three research questions and demonstrate that the process and structure of the educational recommendation system with an AI chatbot can be utilized to create educational recommendation tools in higher education. These tools are accessible anywhere and at any time through small mobile devices. The system is also compatible with popular social media applications and is capable of analyzing user questions precisely and accurately to find the optimal answers that can meet the user's needs. However, there are still gaps in the research that need to be investigated in the future. These studies should include exploring a broader range of applications among the general population and educational settings to assess the effectiveness of the educational recommendation system with an AI chatbot. Additionally, they should examine the skills that impact the utilization of educational technology in various contexts.
29;Identifying student help-seeking behavior patterns and help-seeking tendencies from student problem-solving and help-seeking behavior data: An educational data mining approach;Studies have shown that students have different help-seeking behavior patterns and tendencies and furthermore, that students with certain help-seeking behavior patterns and tendencies may have poor performance (i.e., at-risk students). This study applied an educational data mining approach, including clustering and classification, to analyze students' problem-solving and help-seeking data in a computer assisted learning system to identify student help-seeking behavior patterns and tendencies. First, nine observable problem-solving and help-seeking features for identifying help-seeking behavior patterns were established. Second, this study applied the k-means clustering method and identified three well-known help-seeking behavior patterns: executive, avoidant, and instrumental help-seeking. The results further identified two new help-seeking behavior patterns. One was static instrumental help-seeking and the other was static instrumental and executive help-seeking. Third, executive help-seeking and static instrumental and executive help-seeking patterns could be used as at-risk predicators of poor performance. Fourth, the study applied clustered and identified results to build a minimum distance classifier to identify help-seeking behavior patterns in new data. The study also investigated the accuracy of the classifier in early identifying help-seeking behavior patterns from early-stage data. The early identification accuracy was 61\% for the first three minutes and 75\% for the seven-minutes of early-stage data, respectively. Fifth, this study identified three help-seeking tendencies: independent problem-solvers, executive help-seekers, and static instrumental and executive help-seekers. In summary, the study showed the feasibility and effectiveness of applying an educational data mining approach, including clustering and classification, to build data-driven student models to identify student help-seeking behavior patterns and tendencies.
30;Personalised instructional feedback in a mobile-assisted language learning application using fuzzy reasoning;This paper addresses the interesting issue of mobile-assisted language learning using novel techniques for further improving the adaptivity and personalisation to students. The domain model of the system includes English and French language concepts, and its user model holds information about students and their progress. It also embodies a database of categories of errors and misconceptions which have been reported as common in the related literature. The system is also responsible for conducting model-based error diagnosis using machine learning techniques and identifying errors such as knowledge transfer, spelling or verb mistakes. In conjunction with error diagnosis, the system employs fuzzy logic to automatically model these misconceptions and errors and then provide personalised feedback to students based on their personal learning needs. The system has been fully evaluated, using the CIAO! framework and t-test. The evaluation results are positive and encouraging regarding the educational effectiveness.
31;Student modeling in open-ended learning environments;
32;Individualized Recommender Systems for Teaching: A Systematic Literature Mapping;This paper aims to comprehensively study the current research in individualized recommender systems for education. The study uses a systematic mapping method to classify and organize the literature on this topic. The analysis is based on the frequency of publications within the classification scheme, using 1583 articles from the leading scientific databases of the last five years. The main techniques, tools, and strategies employed in creating and implementing these systems will be identified through this study. Understanding the present status of research in this field is crucial to support these systems' future development.
33;Learning Analytics and Collaborative Groups of Learners in Distance Education: A Systematic Mapping Study;Advances in information and communication technologies have contributed to the increasing use of virtual learning environments as support tools in teaching and learning processes. Virtual platforms generate a large volume of educational data, and the analysis of this data allows useful information discoveries to improve learning and assist institutions in reducing disqualifications and dropouts in distance education courses. This article presents the results of a systematic mapping study aiming to identify how educational data mining, learning analytics, and collaborative groups have been applied in distance education environments. Articles were searched from 2010 to June 2020, initially resulting in 55,832 works. The selection of 51 articles for complete reading in order to answer the research questions considered a group of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Main results indicated that 53\% of articles (27/51) offered intelligent services in the field of distance education, 47\% (24/51) applied methods and analysis techniques in distance education environments, 21\% (11/51) applied methods and analysis techniques focused on virtual learning environments logs and 5\% (3/51) presented intelligent collaborative services for identification and creation of groups. This article also identified research interest clusters with highlights for the terms recommendation systems, data analysis, e-learning, educational data mining, e-learning platform and learning management system.
34;Do personal recommendations need to be personalized? Investigating the relationships between student differences and educational recommendations;Educational recommender systems have been supporting personalized learning in various ways. However, less discussion is conducted about whether and how to personalize the strategies to generate recommendations based on student differences. In this study, we aim at investigating how students judge recommendations based on different strategies, and how these judgments relate to student characteristics. We conducted a large-scale questionnaire survey to measure students' Big-Five personality traits, confidence in the subjects, and their judgments on six types of recommendations. The answers collected from 735 high school students in Japan indicate that students had different judgments across different recommendation strategies, but similarly for English and mathematics. Furthermore, the correlations between student characteristics and their judgments on recommendations were stronger if the subject to learn was inconsistent with the subject they preferred. The results provide insights on how to design educational recommendations that not only cater to students' traits, but also help foster and enhance their traits for better learning.
35;Beyond recommendation acceptance: explanation's learning effects in a math recommender system;Recommender systems can provide personalized advice on learning for individual students. Providing explanations of those recommendations are expected to increase the transparency and persuasiveness of the system, thus improve students' adoption of the recommendation. Little research has explored the explanations' practical effects on learning performance except for the acceptance of recommended learning activities. The recommendation explanations can improve the learning performance if the explanations are designed to contribute to relevant learning skills. This study conducted a comparative experiment (N = 276) in high school classrooms, aiming to investigate whether the use of an explainable math recommender system improves students' learning performance. We found that the presence of the explanations had positive effects on students' learning improvement and perceptions of the systems, but not the number of solved quizzes during the learning task. These results imply the possibility that the recommendation explanations may affect students' meta-cognitive skills and their perceptions, which further contribute to students' learning improvement. When separating the students based on their prior math abilities, we found a significant correlation between the number of viewed recommendations and the final learning improvement for the students with lower math abilities. This indicates that the students with lower math abilities may benefit from reading their learning progress indicated in the explanations. For students with higher math abilities, their learning improvement was more related to the behavior to select and solve recommended quizzes, which indicates a necessity of more sophisticated and interactive recommender system.
36;Recommendation System model integrated with Active Methodologies, EDM, and Learning Analytics for dropout mitigation in Distance Education;Distance Education enabled educational practices based on digital platforms. Despite its wide adoption, the high dropout rates are a reason for concern for teachers and institutional managers. There are initiatives to mitigate this situation, such as Educational Data Mining (EDM), Learning Analytics (LA), and the use of Recommendation Systems (RS). Although effective in specific aspects, these techniques lack mechanisms for students' motivation and pedagogical intervention by teachers, as they do not present methodological proposals to encourage learning. Therefore, this article describes an RS model that shows a differential integration of the pedagogical approach of Active Methodologies with the support of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics techniques to identify students with dropout risks and enhance permanence. For this, a prototype was implemented, and a case study was carried out with professors from two universities to assess functionality and acceptance. According to the TAM Model, more than 87\% of teachers agree with the ease of use, and 77\% agree that RS can be helpful in students' teaching and learning process. Therefore, the model contributes to teaching practices, encourages collaborative learning, and favors monitoring this process and the activities developed by the students.
37;Personalized and Automated Feedback in Summative Assessment Using Recommender Systems;In this study we explore the use of recommender systems as a means of providing automated and personalized feedback to students following summative assessment. The intended feedback is a personalized set of test questions (items) for each student that they could benefit from practicing with. Recommended items can be beneficial for students as they can support their learning process by targeting specific gaps in their knowledge, especially when there is little time to get feedback from instructors. The items are recommended using several commonly used recommender system algorithms, and are based on the students' scores in a summative assessment. The results show that in the context of the Dutch secondary education final examinations, item recommendations can be made to students with an acceptable level of model performance. Furthermore, it does not take a computationally complex model to do so: a simple baseline model which takes into account global, student-specific, and item-specific averages obtained similar performance to more complex models. Overall, we conclude that recommender systems are a promising tool for helping students in their learning process by combining multiple data sources and new methodologies, without putting additional strain on their instructors.
38;A Hybridized Deep Learning Strategy for Course Recommendation;Recommender systems have been actively used in many areas like e-commerce, movie and video suggestions, and have proven to be highly useful for its users. But the use of recommender systems in online learning platforms is often underrated and less likely used. But many of the times it lacks personalisation especially in collaborative approach while content-based doesn't work well for new users. Therefore, the authors propose a hybrid course recommender system for this problem which takes content as well as collaborative approaches and tackles their individual limitations. The authors see recommendation as a sequential problem and thus have used RNNs for solving the problem. Each recommendation can be seen as the new course in the sequence. The results suggest it outperforms other recommender systems when using LSTMs instead of RNNs. The authors develop and test the recommendation system using the Kaggle dataset of users for grouping similar users as historical data and search history of different users' data.
39;Beyond the Classroom: Inspiring Medical and Health Science Students to Learn Surface Anatomy;This qualitative and quantitative study offered students the opportunity to participate in engaging and inspiring activities ``outside the classroom '' , to extend their experience and knowledge of surface anatomy. Medical and health science students benefit from studying surface anatomy as it is relevant to their future professions that deal with patients and clients. Surface anatomy is an essential part of the learning process that allows students an opportunity to identify anatomical structures on living people and to develop their palpation and tactile skills for physical examinations of patients. Body painting is a student-centred, engaging, and motivating approach to learn surface anatomy in anatomy practical classes. In this study, anatomy learning was extended ``beyond the classroom '' through extra-curricular body painting projects. These projects were run by student teams consisting of a student model, student artists (4-5), and a student photographer, under the direction of the chief investigator. A total of sixteen body painting projects were carried out from 2010 to show the skeletal system, the muscular system, pregnancy, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems, and the neurovascular systems of the entire body. A SurveyMonkey of 31/41 active participants suggested that participants enjoyed the projects (94-100\%), found them relevant to their future profession (80-87\%), and considered them to assist with deeper understanding (94\%) and long-term memory (93\%) of anatomy. Learning anatomy outside the classroom through extra-curricular body painting projects was a successful way to engage, motivate, and inspire participants and first year anatomy students to study surface anatomy and to develop their physical examination skills.
40;Designing a recommender system to promote self-regulated learning in online contexts: A design-based study;Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a prerequisite for successful learning. However, studies have reported that many students struggle with self-regulation in online learning, indicating the need to provide students with additional support for SRL. This study adopted a design-based research methodology to iteratively design, implement, and evaluate different SRL recommendation designs. The main study consisted of three cycles, which were conducted in a fully online graduate course. Eighty-one students who enrolled in this course over three semesters participated in the study. The qualitative results generated from student interviews were assessed immediately after each cycle, and students' perceptions were adopted to refine the design of next cycle. The quantitative results were analyzed after the last cycle of the study to examine the effects of different SRL recommendation designs on students' SRL skills and learning performance. The results showed that the different recommendations designs had significant effects on students' SRL skills. The refined system adopted in the last cycle showed the greatest potential for promoting students' SRL skills, although no significant effect was found on their learning performance. These findings resulted in a set of design guidelines that can shed light on future literature, including: (a) incorporate personalization into the design rationale, (b) ensuring the ease of use of the system, (c) enriching users' learning experience, and (d) sustaining users' motivation.
41;Rhetorical Strategies Used by Information Technology Students in In-Class Presentations;Rhetoric plays an important role in helping information technology (IT) professionals communicate their ideas clearly and effectively. By employing rhetorical devices when speaking about technology topics, IT professionals can present logical and convincing arguments, and demonstrate their knowledge and expertise while engaging the audience and making complex technical concepts more accessible for non-experts. This study attempts to understand how IT students construct and develop persuasive arguments by analysing their use of rhetorical strategies in a sample of persuasive presentations delivered in the course ``English for IT '' . Both corpus analysis and manual analysis were used to identify different types of rhetorical strategies students employed to influence their audiences' attitudes. The results show that IT students not only created a logical appeal which might be more natural for them but also employed a wide range of rhetorical strategies and devices to establish disciplinary credibility and create a more personal connection with their audience, thus maintaining an appropriate balance of logos, ethos and pathos. The study further recommends systematic and careful rhetorical analysis of ESP (English for specific purposes) students' spoken language across disciplines and the consequent adaption of learning materials and teaching methods to improve ESP students' rhetoric skills.
42;Lexical Representation of Dense Numerical Vectors: Introducing Langvec;High-dimensional numerical vectors are widely used in machine learning for searching and indexing data. However, it is often difficult for users to interpret their meaning. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that transforms dense vectors into human-readable lexical representations using a percentile-based mapping approach. The essence of the approach is a mapping of words from a predefined/custom lexicon to vectors based on their relative local magnitudes. This way, it enables intuitive visualization of the semantic similarities and differences between complex data points and allows for domain-specific interpretability. It provides an easy way to deduplicate dense vectors (even near-duplicates) and can generate locality-aware hash-like representations, which can be used for efficient indexing and retrieval in various applications. The approach has also been implemented in an open-source library called LangVec. The paper provides examples on LangVec usage and highlights the key applications, including semantic search, recommendation systems, and clustering of numerical data into a human-readable format.
43;A multi-criteria course recommendation system based on the skyline BNL and top-kws algorithms;In today's digital age, online courses have become a valuable tool for learners to acquire new skills and knowledge. The global outbreak of COVID-19 has further accelerated the adoption of online learning as education service providers are forced to move their courses online to ensure the continuity of education. However, with many online courses, learners often find it challenging to select courses that meet their preferences and requirements. To address this issue, recommender systems (RS) have emerged as a popular solution for automatically analysing data and providing personalised recommendations to learners. Our previous work proposed a course RS based on the skyline block-nested-loops (BNL) algorithm. This algorithm filters courses based on multiple criteria, such as course duration, price, difficulty level, and rating, allowing learners to select courses that meet their specific preferences. However, the skyline BNL algorithm has limitations when learners must consider several criteria simultaneously. This limitation led us to propose a new RS that combines skyline BNL and top-k weighted sum (top-kws). The top-kws algorithm ranks courses based on a weighted sum of their features, allowing learners to select courses based on their relative importance.
44;Personalised recommendation method for MOOC online educational resources: collaborative filtering algorithm;In order to address the practical challenges associated with the low recall rate, accuracy, and user satisfaction in conventional personalised recommendation approaches for educational materials, a personalised recommendation method for MOOC online educational resources based on collaborative filtering algorithm is proposed. The mean shift clustering algorithm is used for clustering processing of MOOC platform data, and the MFA algorithm is used to dimensionality reduction process the clustering results. Learner interest are determined by considering the label preference based on frequency weight, time weight, comprehensive frequency and time, as well as learners' interest preferences for label clusters. Based on the analysis of learner interest, personalised recommendation of MOOC online education resources is achieved using a collaborative filtering algorithm based on semi-supervised learning. Experimental results show that the maximum recall rate of this method is 98.3\%, the maximum recommendation accuracy is 97.8\%, the mean learner satisfaction is 97.95, indicating good recommendation effectiveness.
45;An Automatic Optimal Course Recommendation Method for Online Math Education Platforms Based on Bayesian Model;"Online education platforms inject new vitality into the field of education, and greatly improves the accessibility to high-quality education resources. However, the current online education platforms do not support independent course selection based on personal preferences. To solve this problem, this paper designs an automatic recommendation method of optimal courses for online math education platforms based on Bayesian model. The results show that the Bayesian model can simulate the causal relationship between real-world affairs by building a graphic model based on the graph theory and the probability theory; the model can effectively merge priori and posteriori information, and encode the causality between knowledge points; the model clearly outshines user-based collaborative filtering model, term-based collaborative filtering model, and SlopeOne model, and achieves a stable accuracy rate in automatic recommendation of courses. The research provides an empirical evidence to the improvement and innovation of professional online math course platforms."
46;Enhancing Academic Decision-Making: A Pilot Study of AI-Supported Journal Selection in Higher Education;This pilot study explores the potential role of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in enhancing the academic manuscript-to-journal matching process, focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through a focused evaluation of LLM-based recommendation systems, the study analyzes their performance across 40 papers from four distinct disciplines: law, psychology, exact sciences, and engineering. The research uniquely compares LLM-generated journal suggestions to expert human evaluations, providing insights into LLM's strengths and limitations. Findings reveal that while LLMs excel in fields with well-established publishing norms, such as psychology and exact sciences, they struggle with interdisciplinary research, niche topics, and emerging fields, particularly in law and engineering. The study contributes new evidence by identifying specific patterns in LLM's performance across disciplines and highlighting critical challenges, such as regional journal biases and the inability to fully address innovative or complex methodologies. These insights establish a foundation for improving AI systems and emphasize the importance of integrating AI capabilities with human expertise for a balanced, efficient, and effective approach to journal selection.
47;Optimization Analysis and Implementation of Online Wisdom Teaching Mode in Cloud Classroom Based on Data Mining and Processing;The rapid development of Internet technology and information technology is rapidly changing the way people think, recognize, live, work and learn. In the context of Internet + education, the emerging learning form of a cloud classroom has emerged. Cloud classroom refers to the process in which learners use the network as a way to obtain learning objectives and learning resources, communicate with teachers and other learners through the network, and build their own knowledge structure. Because it breaks the boundaries of time and space, it has the characteristics of freedom, high efficiency and extensiveness, and is quickly accepted by learners of different ages and occupations. The traditional cloud classroom teaching mode has no personalized recommendation module and cannot solve an information overload problem. Therefore, this paper proposes a cloud classroom online teaching system under the personalized recommendation system. The system adopts a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, which helps to mine the potential preferences of users and thus complete more accurate recommendations. It not only highlights the core position of personalized curriculum recommendation in the field of online education, but also makes the cloud classroom online teaching mode more intelligent and meets the needs of intelligent teaching.
48;Reuse of e-learning personalization components;Personalized learning systems use several components in order to create courses adapted to the learners'characteristics. Current emphasis on the reduction of costs of development of new resources has motivated the reuse of the e-learning personalization components in the creation of new components. Several systems have been proposed in the literature. Each system implements a specific approach and includes a set of software components. However, many of these components are not easily reusable. This paper proposes an architecture, which aims to improve the representation of learning components in a reusable and interoperable way. As a result, these components could be integrated easily for the creation of personalized learning courses. This architecture consists of five main packages: learner model, adaptation model, reuse facilities, learner interface and pedagogical knowledge. An experiment is conducted to validate the proposed architecture. The obtained results illustrate the optimal composition of e-learning personalization components through an example.
49;Supervised Machine Learning Model to Predict the Bank Loan Application Using Binary Classification, Decision Tree and Random Forest;This paper presents an online fraud detection system that uses anomaly detection to monitor an individual's behavior pattern and compare it with its usage history, which is a representation of the user's normal behavior patterns. Fraud is indicated by any significant deviation from normal behavior. The mechanism suffers from three disadvantages. Limited observations from the historical data, assorted nature of transaction data, and highly distorted information lead to unusually high positive failure rates of anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose a ranking metric embedding-based multi-contextual behavior profiling (ReMEMBeR) model to incorporate the detection mechanism effectively. We transform the original anomaly detection problem into a pseudo-recommender system problem and solve it using a ranking metric embedding-based method. With collaborative filtering, an individual could utilize information from similar individuals implicitly and automatically, which alleviates the individual's possible lack of historical data. By the ranking scheme, the model is trained to maximize the ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. This helps to make full use of label information and, thus, solves the data skewness problem to the utmost extent. The proposed model integrates multi-contextual behaviour patterns, from purely local to more global ones. Evaluating transactions against multi- contextual behaviour patterns could reduce the error rate and, hence, could bring down the false positive rate. By creating a contrast vector for each transaction based on the customer's past behavior sequence, we profile the differentiation rate of each current transaction against the customer's behavior preference.
50;Science teacher's assessment of their students' models;"This study explores science teachers' assessment of their students' models. The Questionnaire of Assessment Literacy (QALMBT-Modeling) was developed to investigate the range of in-service science teachers (ISTs)' assessment practices in model-based teaching (MBT). The questionnaire was informed by an assessment literacy (AL) framework and rooted in studies on modelling in science education. This Likert-type scale questionnaire was administered to 386 middle and high school science teachers in Chile. Statistical analyses demonstrated strong reliability and structural validity of the scale and exploratory factor analysis revealed three key dimensions of AL in MBT (ALMBT): (1) assessment strategies to elicit, evaluate, and support student modelling; (2) facilitation of student-led evaluation and refinement of models through peer and self-assessment, (3) and communication of assessment criteria for student models. Analysis of item-level data showed that while teachers frequently provide feedback and evaluate students' conceptual understanding of models, they less often involve students in peer/self-assessment or use student-generated criteria to assess models which are practices critical to epistemic growth in MBT. This work supports future efforts to refine assessment practices and promote reflective, model-rich science instruction, particularly during the evaluation and modification phases of the instructional cycle."
51;Sharing Digital Health Educational Resources in a One-Stop Shop Portal: Tutorial on the Catalog and Index of Digital Health Teaching Resources (CIDHR) Semantic Search Engine;Background: Access to reliable and accurate digital health web-based resources is crucial. However, the lack of dedicated search engines for non -English languages, such as French, is a significant obstacle in this field. Thus, we developed and implemented a multilingual, multiterminology semantic search engine called Catalog and Index of Digital Health Teaching Resources (CIDHR). CIDHR is freely accessible to everyone, with a focus on French-speaking resources. CIDHR has been initiated to provide validated, high-quality content tailored to the specific needs of each user profile, be it students or professionals. Objective: This study's primary aim in developing and implementing the CIDHR is to improve knowledge sharing and spreading in digital health and health informatics and expand the health-related educational community, primarily French speaking but also in other languages. We intend to support the continuous development of initial (ie, bachelor level), advanced (ie, master and doctoral levels), and continuing training (ie, professionals and postgraduate levels) in digital health for health and social work fields. The main objective is to describe the development and implementation of CIDHR. The hypothesis guiding this research is that controlled vocabularies dedicated to medical informatics and digital health, such as the Medical Informatics Multilingual Ontology (MIMO) and the concepts structuring the French National Referential on Digital Health (FNRDH), to index digital health teaching and learning resources, are effectively increasing the availability and accessibility of these resources to medical students and other health care professionals. Methods: First, resource identification is processed by medical librarians from websites and scientific sources preselected and validated by domain experts and surveyed every week. Then, based on MIMO and FNRDH, the educational resources are indexed for each related knowledge domain. The same resources are also tagged with relevant academic and professional experience levels. Afterward, the indexed resources are shared with the digital health teaching and learning community. The last step consists of assessing CIDHR by obtaining informal feedback from users. Results: Resource identification and evaluation processes were executed by a dedicated team of medical librarians, aiming to collect and curate an extensive collection of digital health teaching and learning resources. The resources that successfully passed the evaluation process were promptly included in CIDHR. These resources were diligently indexed (with MIMO and FNRDH) and tagged for the study field and degree level. By October 2023, a total of 371 indexed resources were available on a dedicated portal. Conclusions: CIDHR is a multilingual digital health education semantic search engine and platform that aims to increase the accessibility of educational resources to the broader health care-related community. It focuses on making resources ``findable, '' ``accessible, '' ``interoperable, '' and ``reusable '' by using a one -stop shop portal approach. CIDHR has and will have an essential role in increasing digital health literacy.
52;Ontology-Driven Project Recommendation for Intelligent Recommender System;The growing intersection of educational technology and personalized learning has led to the development of sophisticated Recommender Systems (RSs) that enhance learner engagement. This article introduces PEARL (Project Engagement and Affinity Recommender with Learning), a novel ontology-driven RS designed for Project-Based Collaborative Learning (PBCL) environments. PEARL integrates collaborative filtering, decision algorithms, and ontology-based personalization to generate context-aware project recommendations that align with learners' competencies and pedagogical goals. At the core of PEARL is an intelligent recommendation engine that employs feedback loops to iteratively refine predictions by analyzing learner interactions, project characteristics, and group dynamics. Empirical validation conducted in a Python programming course demonstrated the framework's effectiveness, achieving precision and recall rates of 82\% and 78\%, respectively. These metrics highlight PEARL's ability to deliver relevant and engaging project suggestions while maintaining a balance between individual personalization and collaborative team formation. PEARL has shown significant potential to improve learner engagement and project completion rates, establishing it as a valuable advancement in educational technology. These findings contribute to the development of adaptive and intelligent RS tailored for PBCL environments.
53;Learner Modeling in Educational Games Based on Fuzzy Logic and Gameplay Data;"Over the last years there has been a growing interest in the use of educational games as learning tools. Educational games have proven to contribute in enhancing student motivation, increasing their engagement and providing them with personalized and adaptive learning. Learner modeling is a prerequisite when it comes to adaptive learning; it is used to represent student's knowledge, needs, and characteristics. This paper presents a modeling technique based on fuzzy logic that uses gameplay data and expert rules to predict learners preferred learning and playing styles. To test the fuzzy rule-based systems, the educational game Woodland was designed bearing in mind the VARK learning styles and the Bartle playing styles. High school students played the educational game Woodland and the results of the FRBSs were compared with the result of the questionnaires. A great correlation was found between the FRBSs results and the questionnaire results."
54;Survey of Machine Learning Techniques for Student Profile Modelling;Developments in information technology have led to the emergence of several online platforms for educational purposes, such as e-learning platforms, e-recommendation systems, e-recruitment system, etc. These systems exploit advances in Machine Learning to provide services tailored to the needs and profile of students. In this paper, we propose a state of art on student profile modelling using machine learning techniques during last four years. We aim to analyse the most used and most efficient machine learning techniques in both online and face-to-face education context, for different objectives such as failure, dropout, orientation, academic performance, etc. and also analyse the dominant features used for each objective in order to achieve a global view of the student profile model. Decision Tree is the most used and the most efficient by most of research studies. And academic, personal identity and online behaviour are the top characteristics used for the student profile. To strengthen the survey results, an experiment was carried out, based on the application of machine learning techniques extracted from the state of art analysis, on the same datasets. Decision tree gave the highest performance, which confirms the survey results.
55;A Categorization of Workplace Learning Goals for Multi-Stakeholder Recommender Systems: A Systematic Review;Educational recommender systems offer benefits for workplace learning by tailoring the selection of learning activities to the individual's learning goals. However, existing systems focus on the learner as the primary stakeholder of learning processes and do not consider the organization's perspective. We conducted a systematic review to develop a categorization of workplace learning goals for multi-stakeholder recommender systems. Out of an initial set of 13,198 publications exported from databases, a final sample of 34 key publications was identified, according to predefined inclusion criteria. Content analysis and reflective exchange were deployed to synthesize workplace learning goals investigated in the key publications. We identified five categories of workplace learning goals that can be arranged along a dimension from intrinsic (goals set exclusively by the learner) to external (goals set exclusively by the organization). Our categorization provides a common language for multi-stakeholder recommender systems incorporating both the learner's and the organization's perspectives.
56;Extract Tacit Knowledge in the Learner Model of the Smart Tutoring System;Knowledge management (KM) is one of the main factors that have become extremely popular in recent years. KM is the processes which people explain information data using scientific and technological media and summarize it into concepts and rules to generate knowledge. This later can be implicit or explicit one. The aim of this contribution is to convert the tacit knowledge into explicit using Metaheuristics techniques. This paper aims to develop a model for converting tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, using the Metaheuristics algorithm for the E-learning platform. For that purpose, the knowledge conversion process will respect the following steps: define the source of tacit knowledge and their methods, classify the tacit knowledge, then we evaluate the implicit knowledge conversion.
57;Memory-Based Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Learner Modeling: Towards Early Prediction of Learners' Performance in Computational Thinking;Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in addressing educational challenges in digital learning. Despite this potential, there are still concerns about the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI methods. Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) not only provide interpretability and the ability to integrate data-driven insights with expert judgment for enhanced trustworthiness but also effectively process temporal dynamics and relationships in data, crucial for early predictive modeling tasks. This research introduces an approach for the temporal modeling of learners' computational thinking abilities that incorporates higher-order influences of latent variables (hereafter referred to as memory of the model) and accordingly predicts learners' performance early. Our findings on educational data from the AutoThinking game indicate that when using only first-order influences, our proposed model can predict learners' performance early, with an 86\% overall accuracy (i.e., time stamps 0, 5, and 9) and a 94\% AUC (at the last time stamp) during cross-validation and 91\% accuracy and 98\% AUC (at the last time stamp) in a holdout test. The introduction of higher-order influences improves model accuracy in both cross-validation and holdout tests by roughly 4\% and improves the AUC at timestamp 0 by roughly 2\%. This suggests that integrating higher-order influences into a DBN not only potentially improves the model's predictive accuracy during the cross-validation phase but also enhances its overall and time stamp-specific generalizability. DBNs with higher-order influences offer a trustworthy and interpretable tool for educators to foresee and support learning progression.
58;Early prediction of mid-term and final scores using deep learning models;The use of learner modelling approaches is critical for providing adaptive support in educational computer games, with predictive learner modelling being among the key approaches. While adaptive supports have been shown to improve the effectiveness of educational games, improperly customized support can have negative effects on learning outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel approach, called DeepLM, that considers a series of time windows representing both sequences of learners' actions during gameplay and estimation of their current competencies (using stealth assessment) to model learners and accordingly predict their future performance. The approach employs a variant of deep neural networks to early predict learners' midterm and final scores simultaneously. The results show that using 20-50\% of learners' action sequences can early predict their final scores, with a cross-validated convolutional neural network (CNN) achieving an area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy of 0.879 and 85.3\%, respectively. The same model can also achieve high accuracy in predicting midterm and final scores at the same time, with an AUC and accuracy of 0.848 and 77.9\%. Overall, the CNN model outperforms recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, and baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP) models in predicting learners' final performance and performs better than the baseline MLP model in predicting learners' midterm and final performance using both cross-validation and independent datasets. These findings show the potential of the proposed approach in accurately early predicting learners' performance, allowing educators and game designers to tailor interventions and support mechanisms that could lead to optimized learning outcomes.
59;A Personalized English Learning Material Recommendation System Based on Knowledge Graph;The world has rushed into the information age. As the lingua franca, English shapes the global landscape of information transmission and exchange. Mastering English is equivalent to possessing an important tool for acquiring precious information. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve English teaching. This paper analyzes the problems in traditional classroom teaching and online learning of English, and discusses how to keep students unbaffled in online learning, improve their English learning efficiency, and satisfy their personalized demands. Specifically, the relevant data were characterized by knowledge points in English teaching, and used to formulate a knowledge graph. Then, the related knowledge points were labeled in online learning data on learning platforms. After that, user portrait was created by analyzing the data on daily learning behaviors. Finally, collaborative filtering was coupled with content-based recommendation to push English learning resources to students, which meet their personalized demands.
60;An intelligent expert system for academic advising utilizing fuzzy logic and semantic web technologies for smart cities education;Students attending Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are faced with a variety of complex decisions and procedures. To provide students with more sustained and personalized advising, many HEIs turn to online academic advising systems and tools as a way to minimize costs and streamline their advising services. However, in such systems, uncertainty in the learner's parameters is a factor, which makes the decision-making process more difficult. Fuzzy logic, a multivalued logic similar to human thinking and interpretation, is highly suitable and applicable for developing knowledge-based academic advising systems that conserve the inherent fuzziness in learner models. In this paper, an innovative hybrid software infrastructure is presented which integrates expert system, fuzzy reasoning, and ontological tools to provide reliable recommendations to students for the next appropriate learning step. The software comprises a fuzzy logic component that determines the student's interest degree for a specific academic choice accompanied by an ontological model and a conventional rule-based expert system for the composition of personalized learning pathways. In order for the system to recommend the next step of the learning pathway, the output of the fuzzy logic component together with the knowledge that is modeled as part of the multi-facet ontology and the machine perceptible academic advising guidelines expressed as semantic rules interoperate in a dynamic and seamless manner. The paper presents the key modeling artifacts of the proposed approach and the architecture of the implemented prototype system. During the case study, the developed system yielded satisfactory results in terms of overall inter-rater reliability and usefulness.
61;Mining Web Analytics Data for Information Wikis to Evaluate Informal Learning;Information wikis and especially Wikipedia have become one of the most attractive environments for informal learning. The nature of wikis enables learners to freely navigate the learning environment and independently construct knowledge without being required to follow a predefined learning path in line with the constructivist learning theory. Link-based navigation and keyword-based search methods used on Wikipedia and similar information wikis suffer from many limitations. In our paper, we present an effective recommendation system that provides easier and faster access to relevant content on Wikipedia to support informal learning. In addition, we evaluate the impact of personalized content recommendations on informal learning from Wikipedia and show how web analytics data can be used to get an insight on informal learning in similar environments.
62;Adaptive learning framework for learning computational thinking using educational robotics;Computational thinking (CT) has been promoted worldwide by educational systems and is an essential skill for technological citizens. Various strategies have been planned and developed to help in introducing, improving, and delivering CT. One of the strategies is by creating and developing the supporting tools for CT learning. In this article, educational robotics (ER) is chosen as the focus tool to support CT learning. Each CT and ER has a massive field of study. There are various available reports determining the suitability of CT subject integrated with ER for students' learning. However, all students do not develop similar style of learning and thinking. There is difference in their personal traits. There is a lack of research that designed CT learning through ER specifically based on student's preferences. Besides, it resulted in a challenge to determine the suitability of CT and ER for different kind of preferences. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an adaptive learning (AL) framework for students to deliver learning of CT through ER. The framework consists of three submodels: domain model, student model, and adaptation model. One case study is defined, which is learning the introductory level of CT through ER (CTER). At the end of the study, it can be observed that the AL framework produced positive results in performance and perception for various student categories. It was noted that students utilizing the AL framework had superior understanding of CTER. Individually or collaboratively, all students who applied or did not apply the AL framework in studying the CTER introduction had positive learning outcomes.
63;Adapt Learning Path by Recommending Problems to Struggling Learners;The objective of this work is the creation of a resource recommendation application in Python integrated into the code of the virtual edX platform, which appears as an additional tab in each course. By selecting this tab, learners will have access at any time to their recommended issues for this course, and so they can adapt their learning path. In this article, we present a recommendation algorithm that will be responsible for proposing these problems according to the scores obtained in the problems already performed by the learner. By calculating the similarity with the rest of the classmates, an estimate of the most practical problems for the learner will be made. We also present the different functions and parameters to implement it.
64;Collaborative Filtering Recommendation of Online Learning Resources Based on Knowledge Association Model;Online learning platforms are prone to information overload, as they contain a huge number of diverse resources. To solve the problem, domestic and foreign scholars have focused their attention on personalized recommendation of learning resources. However, the existing studies perform poorly in the prediction of online learning paths, failing to clarify the overall knowledge system of students and the associations of resource knowledge. Therefore, this paper explores the collaborative filtering recommendation (CFR) of online learning resources (OLRs) based on knowledge association model. Firstly, the knowledge units were extracted from the semantic information of OLRs, and a knowledge association model was established for OLR recommendation. Next, a CFR algorithm was designed to couple semantic adjacency with learning interest, and used to quantify the semantic similarity of OLRs. The proposed algorithm was proved effective through experiments.
65;Understanding the Roles of Personalization and Social Learning in a Language MOOC Through Learning Analytics;In the last decade, there has been a great deal of interest in language MOOCs (LMOOCs) and their potential to offer learning opportunities for large audiences, including those in disadvantaged communities. However, experiences and research have shown MOOCs to suffer from several challenges. Chief among these have been low participation and completion rates, which are often attributed to limitations in how opportunities for personalisation and social interaction are implemented. For the current study, a dedicated LMOOC was designed and implemented, called the ``Social and Personal Online Language Course (SPOLC). '' This language learning environment incorporates a recommendation system and emphasizes personalisation and social interaction. The study identified the types of learning behaviour that were related to course completion and observed how 270 learners in the LMOOC used the various course features. The data were collected using learning analytical methods and analysed using binary logistic regression and feature extraction prediction model. The results demonstrated that working in groups and creating a learning plan were important factors associated with course completion, while interacting with other learners online was not. We conclude with several suggestions and implications for future LMOOC design, implementation, and research.
66;Mapping of learning style with learning object metadata for addressing cold-start problem in e-learning recommender systems;In the e-learning domain, content recommender systems had evolved to recommend relevant learning contents based on the learner preferences. One of the significant drawbacks of content recommenders in the e-learning domain is the new user cold-start problem. The objective of this study is to propose a recommendation model for addressing the cold-start problem using learner's learning style alone. Learning style refers to the way a learner prefers to learn and it is a prominent learner characteristic to understand the learner profile. In this study, we propose an ontology-based recommendation algorithm that makes use of the learning dimensions of the Felder Silverman Learning Style Model to map with the learning object characteristics. The knowledge about the learner and the learning objects are represented using ontology. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed recommendation model using the evaluation metric and f-measure. The learner satisfaction with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given to the learning objects by the participants of the experiment.
67;Poietic symbiosis or algorithmic subjugation: generative AI technology in marketing communications education;This exploratory study investigates the convergence of marketing communications and AI-powered technology in higher education, adopting a perspective on student interactions with generative AI tools. Through a comprehensive content analysis of learners' responses, we employed a blend of manual scrutiny, Python-generated Word Cloud, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to expose the nature of interaction between learners and AI tools. Our findings indicate that learners predominantly adhere to the perception of AI as a tool resembling a `brush' in the creative process, rather than as an active co-creator - the percaption that is aligned with the conventional tool-user dynamic. Students articulated a dual narrative regarding AI: they acknowledged its utility in enhancing creativity, yet expressed concerns about overreliance potentially eroding their own creative skills. Heidegger's exploration of different modes of `revealing' and Deleuze and Guattari's notions of desiring machines and machinic enslavement suggest an alternative perspective where technology, and by extension AI-empowered technology, can contribute to a deeper existential understanding. This study points out the possibility of moving beyond a simple tool-user model, suggesting the emergence of more complex plausible scenarios of interaction: poietic symbiosis or algorithmic subjugation.
68;Elephant Tusks and Natural Selection: Leveraging Naive Student Models to Identify and Address Misconceptions Surrounding Biological Evolution;Evolutionary theory is foundational to the life sciences because it unifies complex ecological principles and explains variation observed between and within species. Students at the secondary level often lack deep conceptual understanding of evolutionary theory, which is crucial to grasp topics related to primary drivers within populations such as inter- and intra-specific competition, predation, and reproductive success. Nonetheless, evolution remains a contentious topic in the United States. The prevalence of pseudoscientific belief among the U.S. populace warrants a calculated approach to deconstructing student misconceptions. This article puts forth an action-research-supported instructional strategy through which educators can identify and address core student misconceptions regarding evolutionary theory and other complex scientific phenomena, utilizing real-world and student-generated models to drive instruction.
69;A case-based reasoning and ontology-based hybrid recommender system for student orientation in higher education;The orientation programs in most of the schools do not mitigate the diverse necessities of students. In addition, the instability of the labor market and the complexity of life have a great impact on young people's career choices. Faced with these concerns, high school students get confused when choosing a college major. Furthermore, the explosion of data on the Internet has caused most of the Internet users to make possible unsuitable decisions when browsing the Web, due to their inability to handle such large amounts of data. In this paper, the Case-based reasoning, and Ontology-based Hybrid Recommender System (COHRS) is proposed to assist high school students deciding the appropriate university/college, university major and career domain that best fit their preferences. COHRS uniquely combines case-based reasoning, collaborative filtering, knowledge base and ontology to explore the top N recommendations based on their fields of interest. The system has been evaluated on Lebanese students through a real-life dataset collected from different Lebanese cities. The first tests carried out on 60 high school students in Beirut city showed an average satisfaction level of 91.7\% of the recommended results from the proposed system and 93.3\% of them found the system very useful. The proposed system achieved an average accuracy level of 98\% and 95\% to retrieve the most similar cases and to extract appropriate recommendations respectively, which provides a very insightful capability to guide high school students in their future directions.
70;Applying cognitive diagnostic models to mechanics concept inventories;In physics education research, instructors and researchers often use research-based assessments (RBAs) to assess students' skills and knowledge. In this paper, we support the development of a mechanics cognitive diagnostic to test and implement effective and equitable pedagogies for physics instruction. Adaptive assessments using cognitive diagnostic models provide significant advantages over fixed-length RBAs commonly used in physics education research. As part of a broader project to develop a cognitive diagnostic assessment for introductory mechanics within an evidence-centered design framework, we identified and tested the student models of four skills that cross content areas in introductory physics: apply vectors, conceptual relationships, algebra, and visualizations. We developed the student models in three steps. First, we based the model on learning objectives from instructors. Second, we coded the items on RBAs using the student models. Finally, we then tested and refined this coding using a common cognitive diagnostic model, the deterministic inputs, noisy ``and '' gate model. The data included 19 889 students who completed either the Force Concept Inventory, Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation, or Energy and Momentum Conceptual Survey on the LASSO platform. The results indicated a good to adequate fit for the student models with high accuracies for classifying students with many of the skills. The items from these three RBAs do not cover all of the skills in enough detail, however, they will form a useful initial item bank for the development of the mechanics cognitive diagnostic.
71;Examining Teachers' Professional Learning in an Online Asynchronous System: Personalized Supports for Growth and Engagement in Learning to Teach Statistics and Data Science;Teachers' professional learning often includes online components. This study examined how a case of 37 teachers utilized a specific online asynchronous professional learning platform designed to support teachers' growth in learning to teach statistics and data science in secondary schools in the United States. The platform's features and learning materials were designed based on effective online learning designs, supports for self-guided learning, and research on the teaching and learning of statistics and data science. We paid particular attention to the features we designed into the platform to support self-regulation and personalizing the experiences to meet their preferred learning goals such as allowing for free choice of learning materials, flexibility of when and how long to engage, providing personal recommendations based on user input, internal systems to track progress, and generating certificates of completion. In this study, we used a case study with both quantitative and qualitative data to examine whether teachers had gains in meeting learning goals related to their development in teaching statistics and data science, had sustained engagement, and found the features for personalization supportive for their learning. Results showed, overall, positive growth towards meeting learning goals and making small changes towards improved classroom practice. Most teachers were generally engaged in sustained ways across the study period, though we found six different patterns of completion that highlight ways in which teachers' goal-directed and self-regulated learning occurred within the busy schedules of educators. Several personalized features, especially the recommendations and tracking system, were highly utilized and perceived as supportive of teachers' learning.
72;Effect of OSLM features and gamification motivators on motivation in DGBL: pupils' viewpoint;The primary question of this study is whether OLM and OSLM mechanisms, when used in a digital game, offer higher motivation. Furthermore, the study investigates whether a game's aesthetics and mechanics support players' intrinsic motivation. Both claims are tested through the design, implementation and pilot use of the Multiplication Game (MG). MG is a digital learning activity that supports pupils in achieving multiplication competence and provides teacher a dashboard to assess and watch own pupils' performance. The game enriched with gamification elements to engage and motivate participants. Three versions of the game were used by pupils: without any Open Learner Modeling (OLM) support (i.e. without providing access to own progress data), with OLM support and with Open Social Learner Modeling (OSLM) support, to investigate the difference in motivation among these characteristics. After using the MG for a 2-month period, pupils answered a questionnaire anonymously to express their opinion about MG mechanics, MG aesthetics and intrinsic motivation MG can offer. Furthermore, the corresponding teachers were interviewed to provide insights on their attitude towards MG and its functionalities. A statistically significant difference in Intrinsic Motivation (IM) between the three different MG versions was found and a statistically significant difference in MG Aesthetics and Mechanics between the different grades of primary school. Additionally, Intrinsic Motivation was positively correlated with gamification motivators and MG Aesthetics. Participating teachers stated that MG can improve pupils' multiplication competence and it is worthy of a stable place in the instructional procedure, as it is a means of pupils' progress tracking and (self-) assessment, as well as a fun way of practicing and developing multiplication skills.
73;Developing children's algorithmic literacies through curatorship as media literacy;Children in current times are likely to encounter algorithms, particularly recommendation systems, as part of their everyday media experiences. In this paper we consider children's use of algorithms from a media literacy perspective, namely through curatorship practices. We detail a pilot workshop where children had opportunities to develop understandings and critically reflect on algorithms through non-digital media production. Children engaged in the process of curation through a series of activities where they took photos and then curated these images in a variety of ways. The activity provided opportunities for the children to critically reflect on algorithms, specifically recommendation systems, in ways that moved them beyond experience. One part of the pilot was to consider the inter-relations evident between digital and more traditional texts, materials and resources and the opportunities afforded when diverse materials and tools are brought together in the one event. The pilot explored different activities to help participants consider how algorithms are part of, and impact, their everyday literacy and media practices.
74;Implications of considering Response Process Data for Greater and Lesser Psychometrics;This paper characterizes the ways in which increased attention to response process data has implications for psychometrics. To do so, this work draws on two organizing frameworks that have heretofore not been associated: evidence-centered design, and the distinction between greater and lesser statistics. Overlaying these frameworks leads to a conceptualization of greater and lesser psychometrics. This provides a conceptual space for articulating the ways in which response process data have implications for lesser psychometrics through measurement models, as well as greater psychometrics through student models, task models, and the social and personal contexts in which assessment takes place. To illustrate the key points and motivate discussions of where future research is needed, I draw from experiences with three assessments that have involved response process data: a task assessing the measurement of geometric area, a performance-based assessment of computer networking, and an educational video game targeting rational number addition.
75;A study on the recommendation method of intelligent media learning resources in the foreign communication and teaching of international communication of Chinese central plains culture;Today, with the development of intelligent media, the foreign communication and teaching activities of the Chinese central plains culture should actively seek experiences that can be learned from, establish a multi-channel foreign communication mode, and then promote the Chinese central plains culture to go out of the country and into the world better. The study improves the collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm and the joint matrix decomposition algorithm based on the theory of migration learning, aiming to improve the learning to optimize the resource recommendation system by calculating the user similarity and establishing the user preference-resource feature matrix. The experimental results show that the average absolute error and root mean square error of the improved algorithms are lower than those of other algorithms, proving that the optimized algorithms improve the accuracy and efficiency of resource recommendation in the foreign communication and teaching activities of the Chinese central plains culture while operating stably and with wide applicability on the recommendation system.
76;Optimizing personalised recommender systems for teachers' digital learning models using deep learning algorithms;Digital Learning Models for Teachers is an important educational development to improve teaching effectiveness through digital technology. It creates learning experiences with personalization and customization by providing teachers with more accurate feedback on their teaching. However, the current problem is that the learning question types must be recommended according to the students' needs, leading to inadequate learning effects. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a personalized recommendation algorithm based on a graph neural network for teachers' digital learning models (PRAGNN). In particular, firstly, integrating DINA cognitive diagnosis and gray partial correlation evaluation is used to construct a student model by modeling students' mastery of knowledge points and cognitive ability level. Secondly, a graph convolutional neural network is introduced and combined with the sequential relationship between subject knowledge points to automatically capture the semantic information of higher-order structures in the knowledge points to achieve personalized recommendations. Ultimately, the algorithm achieved 85.60\% accuracy through comparative experiments. This research provides a new idea for constructing a personalized recommendation system for the digital learning model of teachers, it has significant value for the sustainable development of lifelong learning that promotes mutual growth between teachers and students.
77;Design and Implementation of Intelligent Textbooks: From a Perspective of Digital Transformation in Education *;With the application of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) in education, a new form of textbook construction has been developed, promoting digital textbook development. However, problems during digital textbook construction still exist. This study analyzes the necessity of intelligent textbook development and explains the educational characteristics of intelligent textbooks, such as intelligent adaptation learning, intelligent guidance, accompanying evaluation, and in-depth learning interaction from the perspective of instruction theory. Moreover, combining the technical advantages of AI, including knowledge mapping, learning analysis, online tracking, learner digital profiles, and in-depth interaction, and taking existing achievements for reference, it describes the methods and strategies of intelligent textbooks to achieve corresponding educational functions and also makes interpretation with specific cases. Given the educational and engineering characteristics of intelligent textbooks, this study analyzes the strategies for promoting the construction of intelligent textbooks from adhering to the instruction theory, paying attention to the iteration of practice, and adopting technical methods to supervise and regulate.
78;Bayesian network algorithms used in the assessment of learners' learning behaviour;In order to solve the problem that teachers cannot monitor learners' learning behaviour or evaluate learners' learning objectively and scientifically because of the relative separation of time and space between teachers and students, covering Bayesian network learning evaluation model based on knowledge relationship is proposed. The information related to students can be divided into two parts: domain-related information and domain-independent information. Firstly, the modelling of domain-related information is mainly discussed. The process of domain-related information modelling is the Bayesian networking process of the courses that students have learned. Secondly, the time and space complexity of the algorithm is reduced by simplifying the network structure and optimising the order of node deletion in the triangulation process. The results show that the model can accurately judge the degree of students' mastery of knowledge, and can provide students with personalised guidance strategy.
79;Utilizing Deep Learning AI to Analyze Scientific Models: Overcoming Challenges;Scientific modeling is a vital educational practice that helps students apply scientific knowledge to real-world phenomena. Despite advances in AI, challenges in accurately assessing such models persist, primarily due to the complexity of cognitive constructs and data imbalances in educational settings. This study addresses these challenges by employing diverse analytic strategies, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), aimed at enhancing fairness and efficacy in automated scoring systems. We analyze the impact of these strategies through a robust methodology, utilizing a combination of tenfold cross-validation and independent testing phases to ensure the reliability of AI assessments. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of deep learning AI in mirroring human judgment, with improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores across varied model assessments. Specifically, the application of SMOTE significantly improved the scoring fairness for minority class instances, which are often underrepresented in educational datasets. This study also delves into the discrepancies between AI and human evaluations, particularly in interpreting creatively expressed student models, which reveals the areas where AI technologies require further enhancements to better align with human evaluative standards. This study lays a foundation for future research to explore advanced AI techniques and training strategies, thus promoting fair and supportive feedback mechanisms that enhance student learning and creativity. By advancing AI applications in science education, this research addresses essential challenges in the automated analysis of complex student responses and supports broader academic goals.
80;A collaborative filtering and recommendation method for digital resources of Chinese language courses;A collaborative filtering and recommendation method for digital resources of Chinese language courses based on similarity algorithm is studied to solve the problem of low accuracy in recommending digital resources for Chinese language courses. Firstly, collect and normalise digital resource data. Secondly, the TF-IDF algorithm is used to calculate the feature weights of resource data. Then, learning preference features are extracted by calculating the amount of time students spend on web pages and combining that with collaborative filtering algorithms. Finally, a resource similarity matrix is constructed to achieve collaborative filtering and recommendation of digital resources for Chinese language courses based on the Pearson similarity algorithm. It has been proven that the recommendation accuracy of this method is higher than 95\% through experiments, the recommendation time is lower, and the PR curve is closest to the upper right corner, indicating good recommendation performance.
81;Research on personalized recommendation of MOOC resources based on ontology;Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze from multiple perspectives, so as to form an effective massive open online course (MOOC)personalized recommendation method to help learners efficiently obtain MOOC resources. Design/methodology/approach This study introduced ontology construction technology and a new semantic association algorithm to form a new MOOC resource personalized recommendation idea. On the one hand, by constructing a learner model and a MOOC resource ontology model, based on the learner's characteristics, the learner's MOOC resource learning preference is predicted, and a recommendation list is formed.

The hybrid recommendation method that introduces ontology construction technology and performs semantic association analysis can effectively realize the personalized recommendation of MOOC resources. Originality/value This study has formed an effective method for personalized recommendation of MOOC resources, solved the problems existing in the personalized recommendation that is, the recommendation relies on the learner's rating of the resource, the recommendation is specialized, and the knowledge structure of the recommended resource is static, and provides a new idea for connecting MOOC learners and resources.
82;Rater behaviors in peer evaluation: Patterns and early detection with learner model;Peer evaluation is a common practice in team-based learning (TBL) designs, which can cover the assessment of individual or group work. However, the integrity of peer evaluation can be compromised by unserious raters-individuals who do not earnestly engage in the evaluation process. These raters may exhibit behaviors like consistently assigning the same score, rushing through evaluations, or evaluating before or long after the target presentations. This study delves into the issue of unserious peer evaluation in group presentations, with a specific focus on understanding the behavior patterns in the digital system. Utilizing evaluation behavior analysis (EBA) indicators, we identify patterns linked to unserious raters during the peer evaluation process. Meanwhile, we also connect these patterns to rating consistency and actual course performance, underscoring the significance of behavior patterns. Further, we conduct a preliminary analysis to explore the application of learner model data available before the peer evaluation starts for the early detection of unserious raters. This finding can assist teachers in providing personalized prompts and interventions before the peer evaluation stage, hence enhancing the evaluation quality through targeted interventions in a timely manner.
83;Applying a Tri-Learner Model of Extension Collaboration: Local-State-Campus Partnership;. The Tri-Learner model of Extension Collaboration offers an innovative approach to address community needs and advance research by convening faculty from academic research, statewide Extension, and community-embedded Extension. This article describes development of a new Tri-Learner Model through an early childhood resilience project, with data from 32 participants. We present four key factors for the model's success: First, ensure that research and application are responsive to community needs rather than University-driven. Second, establish trusting, reciprocal relationships. Third, equally value each team member's knowledge and skills. Finally, leverage collaborative University structures and/or funding to foster reciprocal partnerships to maximize research impacts.
84;Design of a Learning Path Recommendation System Based on a Knowledge Graph;Current learning platforms generally have problems such as fragmented knowledge, redundant information, and chaotic learning routes, which cannot meet learners' autonomous learning requirements. This paper designs a learning path recommendation system based on knowledge graphs by using the characteristics of knowledge graphs to structurally represent subject knowledge. The system uses the node centrality and node weight to expand the knowledge graph system, which can better express the structural relationship among knowledge. It applies the particle swarm fusion algorithm of multiple rounds of iterative simulated annealing to achieve the recommendation of learning paths. Furthermore, the system feeds back the students' learning situation to the teachers. Teachers check and fill in the gaps according to the performance of the learners in the teaching activities. Aiming at the weak links of students' knowledge points, the particle swarm intelligence algorithm is used to recommend learning paths and learning resources to fill in the gaps in a targeted manner.
85;The Design of Guiding and Adaptive Prompts for Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Its Effect on Students' Mathematics Learning;Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) aim to deliver personalized learning support to each learner, aligning with the educational aspiration of many countries, including China. ITSs' personalized support is mainly achieved by providing individual prompts to learners when they encounter difficulties in problem-solving. The guiding principles and methods of prompts have been less investigated in previous ITS literatures. Based on relevant learning theories, such as self-regulated learning theory, zone of proximal development, scaffolding and heuristic teaching, we proposed seven guiding principles for designing ITS prompts and designed the guiding and adaptive prompts for the difficult questions in a mathematical ITS, math intelligent assessment and teaching system V2.0. In order to verify the effectiveness of this ITS with the aforementioned prompts, we conducted a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment in a high school, where the experimental group followed a process of ``pretest, practice with general prompts and adaptive tutoring, and posttest, '' while the control group followed a process of ``pretest, practice with only general prompts, and posttest. '' We collected the pre and posttest scores of both the experimental and control groups, and log data from the student model within the ITS for the experimental group students. The data analysis indicated that although the experimental group scored lower than the control group in the pretest, they scored higher in the posttest and spent less completion time. The drilled problems and the prompts provided to the experimental group students were personalized. In conclusion, the design principles for guiding and adaptive prompts in the ITS can provide personalized guidance and support for students, thus effectively improve their performance. Those principles are not only valuable for the subject mathematics but also can contribute significantly to the prompt design of other subjects, thereby bolstering the global pursuit of personalized education.
86;Small Data Fusion Algorithm for Personalized Library Recommendations;In order to better grasp the needs of library users and provide them with more accurate knowledge services, combining the characteristics of university libraries, this article applies library small data to personalized recommendation and proposes a small data fusion algorithm model for library personalized recommendation. This model combines the characteristics of small data and realizes multi-dimensional small data fusion by using fully connected neural network to capture the potential collaborative filtering information between users and projects, better grasp the needs of readers and users, and provide valuable assistance for subsequent personalized recommendation research. The effectiveness of the proposed method in personalized recommendation of library resources is verified by comparing several groups of experiments on public and self-built data sets.
87;Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Course-Specific Semantically Annotated Learning Objects;BackgroundOver the past few decades, the process and methodology of automatic question generation (AQG) have undergone significant transformations. Recent progress in generative natural language models has opened up new potential in the generation of educational content.ObjectivesThis paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating computer science questions that are sufficiently annotated for automatic learner model updates, are fully situated in the context of a particular course and address the cognitive dimension understand.MethodsUnlike previous attempts that might use basic methods such as ChatGPT, our approach involves more targeted strategies such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce contextually relevant and pedagogically meaningful learning objects.Results and ConclusionsOur results show that generating structural, semantic annotations works well. However, this success was not reflected in the case of relational annotations. The quality of the generated questions often did not meet educational standards, highlighting that although LLMs can contribute to the pool of learning materials, their current level of performance requires significant human intervention to refine and validate the generated content.
88;CourseQ: the impact of visual and interactive course recommendation in university environments;The abundance of courses available in a university often overwhelms students as they must select courses that are relevant to their academic interests and satisfy their requirements. A large number of existing studies in course recommendation systems focus on the accuracy of prediction to show students the most relevant courses with little consideration on interactivity and user perception. However, recent work has highlighted the importance of user-perceived aspects of recommendation systems, such as transparency, controllability, and user satisfaction. This paper introduces CourseQ, an interactive course recommendation system that allows students to explore courses by using a novel visual interface so as to improve transparency and user satisfaction of course recommendations. We describe the design concepts, interactions, and algorithm of the proposed system. A within-subject user study (N=32) was conducted to evaluate our system compared to a baseline interface without the proposed interactive visualization. The evaluation results show that our system improves many user-centric metrics including user acceptance and understanding of the recommendation results. Furthermore, our analysis of user interaction behaviors in the system indicates that CourseQ could help different users with their course-seeking tasks. Our results and discussions highlight the impact of visual and interactive features in course recommendation systems and inform the design of future recommendation systems for higher education.
89;Investigating course choice motivations in university environments;Recommendation systems need a deeper understanding of users and their motivations to improve recommendation quality and provide more personalized suggestions. This is especially true in the education domain, the more about the student is known, the more useful recommendations can be made. However, although many studies on the course recommendation exist, studies on the students' course selection motivations in universities are limited. This study investigates the factors that contribute to students' choice when selecting courses in universities to better understand student perceptions, attitudes, and needs and leverage data-driven approaches for recommending and explaining the recommendations in university environments. A qualitative interview for university students (N = 10) comprised of open-ended questions as well as a questionnaire for students (N = 81) was conducted, aiming to investigate the main reasons behind their choices. The results of this study show that students highly value the course contents and the benefits of the course towards their future careers. Furthermore, students are influenced by other reasons such as the possibility of obtaining a higher grade, the popularity of professors, and recommendations from peers. Next, we extract the main categories of students' motivations and analyzed the questionnaire data by employing statistical analysis methods as well as the k-means clustering algorithm to identify different types of students in terms of course selection. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for designing more personalized course recommendation systems.
90;Effects of a peer tutor recommender system (PTRS) with machine learning and automated assessment on vocational high school students' computer application operating skills;Many information technology courses frequently use the learning by doing strategy in vocational high schools. Particularly, learning computer application operating skills is essential for students because excellent computer application operating skills can help them attain good jobs. However, when fostering students' computer application operating skills by teaching in vocational high school using the learning by doing strategy, a teacher learns that helping all students, evaluating their learning problems, and providing feedback to correct their mistakes are challenging. After investigating the challenge, a machine-learning-based peer tutor recommender system (MPTRS) with automated assessment was proposed to enhance students' learning performance in computer application operating skills. The advanced automated assessment system (AAS) used computer vision technology to evaluate student assignments and instantly return feedback. The recommendation mechanism of the MPTRS enhanced mutual help among students based on their social relationships, learning performance, and recommendation feedback. Furthermore, machine-learning techniques were used to improve recommendations. In the experiment, the experimental group used the proposed system, and the control group used a conventional commercial automated grading system. From the experimental results, the learning performance of the experimental group significantly improved between the pretest and post-test. Students can correct and complete more assignments using the advanced AAS and students who behind in learning also can use the peer tutor recommender function for asking help. Participants were also satisfied with the proposed advanced AAS and MPTRS. It is worth to promote the proposed system to teachers of adopting the learning-by-doing strategy in computer application classes.
91;Digital Brick: Enhancing the Student Experience Using Blockchain, Open Badges and Recommendations;The main purpose of this work is to describe the process of design and implementation of a novel e-Learning platform, named Digital Brick, intended to enhance the students' experience in obtaining formal certifications of their competencies. The research method we followed starts form a deep study of the state of the art that showed us the need to invest more research effort on delivering open and flexible online environments to enable students in finding and passing courses with final formal certifications of learning. To reach this goal, we (i) designed a complete system architecture around a standard (SCORM compliant) learning management system in order the approach should be reusable as much as possible. We (ii) introduced specific modules to separate responsibilities on the definition and issuing of formal certifications using digital badges according to the IMS Open Badges standard. We (iii) exploited blockchain technology to make the sharing of badges among actors more secure, transparent and open. Finally, we (iv) introduced a new recommendation algorithm based on machine learning techniques to give advice to students about study materials and learning paths. We spent a significant part of our effort carrying out both a functional and quantitative validation of our proposal. The obtained results are presented through a laboratory case study that involves all the components of the architecture, and the outcomes are discussed providing numerical performance indicators. In conclusion, the resulting platform introduces digital badges and blockchain as tools to share recognized achievements among earners and issuers, and machine learning algorithms to provide students with recommendations on the learning material, learning objects, courses and learning paths more suitable for their learning styles.
92;Assessing the impact of ethical aspects of recommendation systems on student trust and engagement in E-learning platforms: A multifaceted investigation;In recent times, there has been a growing interest in enhancing recommendation systems for e-learning platforms to deliver a personalised learning experience that meets each learner's distinct requirements and preferences. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognise the ethical considerations surrounding this technology, as it heavily relies on gathering and analysing students' data, which could potentially affect their level of engagement and trust in online learning settings. This study delves into the ethical considerations surrounding e-learning recommender systems and their impact on students' behaviours, particularly in relation to privacy concerns, trust, and engagement within the online educational environment. The research emphasises various influential factors such as the transparency of the platform, previous exposure to cybersecurity education, and students' backgrounds, including their gender and educational level. The investigation involved 602 students from various academic levels across 11 distinct regions in Morocco, encompassing both rural and urban areas. Among the key findings from the Structural Modelling Analysis (SEM) is that the level of transparency on online learning platforms is a significant factor in building students' trust. However, an excess of transparency can have the opposite effect, leading to disengagement as students become overwhelmed with information. The study also revealed an inverse relationship between cybersecurity education and platform transparency, as increased knowledge can lead to a more critical examination of platform regulation and a heightened awareness of privacy risks. In addition, the research found that individuals with higher levels of education have better cognitive abilities and critical thinking skills, enabling them to understand transparency better. Interestingly, those with higher education also tend to have fewer privacy concerns, likely due to their confidence in security measures and understanding of data handling practices.
93;SBS feature selection and AdaBoost classifier for specialization/major recommendation for undergraduate students;Selecting undergraduate majors or specializations is a crucial decision for students since it considerably impacts their educational and career paths. Moreover, their decisions should match their academic background, interests, and goals to pursue their passions and discover various career paths with motivation. However, such a decision remains challenging are unfamiliar with the job market, the demand for the required skills, and being in the proper placement in a major is not straightforward. Thus, an automatic recommendation system can be helpful for students to assist and guide them in the right decision. In this context, we developed a machine learning model to predict and recommend suitable specializations for undergraduate students according to the job market and student's academic history. Two hundred twenty-five records of students are considered to establish this work. The proposed approach encompasses four major steps, including data preprocessing to clean, scale, and prepare the data for training to avoid obtaining suboptimal results, accompanied by an oversampling process to equal the samples' distribution to prevent the model from being biased or poorly generalized. Furthermore, we conducted a feature selection step using Sequential Backward Selection (SBS) to extract the relevant features to improve the outcomes and reduce the risk of noise. The selected subset is used to train the model using the AdaBoost classifier. We deployed the Genetic algorithm to optimize the classifier's hyperparameters to maximize results. As a result, the findings of this study exhibit noticeable results compared to existing models, with an accuracy of 98.1\%. The proposed model can be reliable in guiding undergraduate students through proper decisions regarding selecting their major.
94;SFS feature selection with decision tree classifier for massive open online courses (MOOCs) recommendation;Online courses have recently gained popularity among millions of students worldwide, primarily due to their accessibility, affordability, and flexibility in accessing high-quality educational content from renowned institutions and universities. Nevertheless, MOOC courses' diversity and standard adjustments make it harder for learners to distinguish the best ones that match their profile and needs. In this context, we developed a Machine Learning model that uses learners' profile information and their interaction history with MOOC platforms to predict and recommend relevant MOOCs. One of the large-scale datasets is used to perform this work, which contains 16 courses and 16 features. Data preprocessing is conducted to clean, scale, and prepare the data for training to avoid having suboptimal results, along with an undersampling to adjust the distribution of samples in classes to prevent poor generalization and bias models. In fact, dealing with a large set of attributes often needs to be diminished to increase the model's performance and reduce the risk of noise and the model's overfitting. In this way, we applied the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) to select the appropriate features for the target classes. The resulting subset of features was then used to train the model using the Decision Tree classifier. As a result, this combination provided noticeable results compared to existing works, with an accuracy of 82.8\%. The proposed model can serve as a reliable tool for assisting learners in online education by providing personalized recommendations for MOOCs based on their individual profiles.
95;Continuous student modeling for programming in the classroom: challenges, methods, and evaluation;
96;Educational Recommender System Based on Learner's Annotative Activity;In recent years, Educational Recommender Systems (ERSs) have attracted great attention as a solution towards addressing the problem of information overload in e-learning environments and providing relevant recommendations to online learners. These systems play a key role in helping learners to find educational resources relevant and pertinent to their profiles and context. So, it is necessary to identify information that helps learner's profile definition and in identifying requests and interests. In this context, we suggest to take advantage of the annotation activity used usually in the learning context for different purposes and which may reflect certain learner's characteristics useful as input data for the recommendation process. Therefore, we propose an educational recommender system of web services based on learner's annotative activity to assist him in his learning activity. This process of recommendation is founded on two preparatory phases: the phase of modelling learner's personality profile through analysis of annotation digital traces in learning environment realized through a profile constructor module and the phase of discovery of web services which can meet the goals of annotations made by learner via the web service discovery module. The evaluation of the developed annotation-based recommendation system through empirical studies realized on groups of learners based on the Student's t-test showed significant results.

98;Beyond compliance: evaluating AfriMEDS competencies in South African medical education;South African medical education confronts systemic challenges rooted in colonial legacies, demanding transformative pedagogies that redress inequities and integrate community health through culturally responsive frameworks. This convergent mixed-methods study, guided by a transformative paradigm emphasizing ethical engagement and social justice, evaluated the implementation of the AfriMEDS framework, a local adaptation of CanMEDS incorporating community-based education (CBE) and community-oriented primary care (COPC) at the University of the Free State (UFS). Methods included curriculum mapping, document analysis, 15 educator interviews, and surveys of 71 medical interns. Document review revealed that health advocate, leader and manager, and scholar roles were minimally featured in phase guides and that existing assessment tools diverged from CanMEDS recommendations. Educator interviews identified three principal barriers: insufficient faculty development (87\% of participants), resource constraints, and misaligned assessment practices. Intern surveys showed only 63\% felt leadership training was adequate, 71\% felt prepared for CBE, and 72\% felt competent in collaboration. These findings expose critical gaps in embedding AfriMEDS competencies, particularly intrinsic roles, within undergraduate training. Our methodological framework highlights how CBE and COPC can serve as catalysts for meaningful curricular reform by fostering sustained collaboration between learners, educators, and communities. We recommend systemic reforms including decolonial pedagogical strategies, robust faculty development in cultural competency, alignment of curricula with national health priorities, and the creation of benchmarked assessment tools that reflect African healthcare contexts and community needs. Failure to implement these reforms risks perpetuating inequity and undermining South Africa's health transformation agenda.
99;Course Correction: Navigating Equity in Ninth-Grade Advanced Placement;This robust mixed-methods study examines ninth-grade advanced course placement in Arkansas, revealing disparities rooted in race and socioeconomic status. Utilizing a logit analysis for a five-year pooled sample (n = 163,616), we find persistent enrollment gaps for Black ninth-grade students after controlling for prior academic achievement, highlighting systemic barriers to access to advanced courses. Socioeconomic divides are also evident in our analysis. Qualitative findings from counselor interviews highlight the importance of parental involvement in course placement decisions, particularly for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Overall, we find through these interviews that districts consider a myriad of factors when considering course placement for ninth-grade courses. We recommend systemic changes for districts, including local norm-based placement systems and automatic enrollment policies to enhance fairness in advanced course placement.
100;Identification and Characterization of Social Network (SN) Profiles in Spanish University Students;This article examines how Spanish university students use Social Media (SM) platforms, which have become a natural means of communication and information for Generation Z due to the expansion of the Internet. The study involved 1,363 students from various fields of knowledge, and the questionnaire data were analysed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Two-Step Cluster Analysis, and K-means. The study found three motivational uses related to self-esteem, perceived control, and family closeness. Four distinct profiles of SM use emerged, including professional contacts and information, communication with others, avoidance of self-identity, and an alternative profile with reduced SM use. These profiles were further characterized by the type and amount of time spent on SM platforms, field of study, sex, and academic year. The study found that female students in Economics and Law primarily use SM for personal contacts, while women in the first years of Human and Social Sciences and Nursing and Physiotherapy tend to use SM to avoid self-identity. Male students in the last years of Engineering and Theology mostly use SM for alternative contacts. Only LinkedIn stands out as a platform for professional contacts. Additionally, the study found that an evasive use of SM platforms is associated with low self-esteem, little perceived control over life, and weak family ties. This finding suggests that educational guidance should focus on improving the training to students to these issues.
101;Onlife youth: a study of young peoples user profile and their online behaviour;The internet has become the main vehicle of communication and self-expression for most young people. Forms of interacting, entertaining oneself and even disconnecting are being increasingly influenced by the hyperconnectivity that these technological devices entail. A quantitative study was conducted to explore the user profile, behaviour and risks involved in screentime in a sample of 2066 Spanish adolescents aged between 12 and 18. A bespoke validated questionnaire was used. Data were analysed via descriptive and inferential statistics. Outcomes reveal that adolescents use their smartphones during leisure time mainly to communicate and interact via social networks, specifically, WhatsApp and Instagram. As adolescents grow older, they spend more time online and share more personal information. There is, therefore, a need for an educational approach aimed at attending to young people's affective, relational and communicational processes to enable them to suitably handle their exposure on social networks.
102;A Data Mining Method for Students' Behavior Understanding;A framework for predicting students' learning performance based on behavioral model is proposed to model students' behavior and describe their behavior characteristics accurately and comprehensively. The framework extracts features from multiple perspectives to describe behaviors more comprehensively, including statistical features and association features. In addition, a multi-task model is designed for fine-grained prediction of students' learning performance in the curriculum. A framework for predicting mastery based on online learning behavior is also put forward. Additional context information is added to the collaborative filtering algorithm including student-knowledge-point mastery, class-knowledge-point, and students' mastery is predicted according to the learning path excavated. Considering the time-varying of mastery, the approximate curve of students' mastery of knowledge points is fitted according to the Ebinhaus forgetting curve. The experiments show that the proposed framework has a high recall rate for the prediction of learning performance and also shows a certain practicability for early warning. Further, based on the model, the correlation between student behavior patterns and learning performance is discussed. The inclusion of additional information has improved the prediction efficiency, especially the operational efficiency. At the same time, the proposed framework can not only dynamically assess students' master of knowledge but also facilitate the system to review feedback or adjust the learning order and provide personalized learning services.
103;Integration of Collaborative Filtering Into Naive Bayes Method to Enhance Student Performance Prediction;This article introduces a novel method that integrates collaborative filtering into the naive Bayes model to enhance predicting student academic performance. The combined approach leverages collaborative user behavior analysis and probabilistic modeling, showing promising results in improved prediction precision. Collaborative Filtering explores user behavior patterns, while Naive Bayes employs Bayes' theorem for probabilistic data classification. Focused on predicting academic success, the integration incorporates collaborative patterns from student data for increased accuracy. The method considers similar students' performance and behavior for nuanced, personalized predictions. Starting with diverse data collection, including collaborative patterns among students, Collaborative Filtering identifies relationships and patterns among those with similar academic histories. These insights enrich the naive Bayes algorithm, creating a holistic approach for more accurate predictions, and contributing to ongoing machine learning initiatives in education.
104;Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Implemented in a Telecommunications Serious Game;The University of Johannesburg has integrated serious games into its teaching, exemplified by Codebreakers, a 2D game teaching information theory. While successful, Codebreakers lacked personalisation and used a criticised assessment method based on answer streaks. Knowledge tracing algorithms, known for their effectiveness in intelligent tutoring systems, were considered to address these limitations. This led to the research question: ``Can a new serious game be designed, incorporating knowledge tracing algorithms to deliver personalised learning experiences in telecommunications education? '' In response, an escape-themed serious game was developed, integrating Bayesian Knowledge Tracing as a statistical student model for personalised learning. This innovative approach combines free-roam gameplay with tailored educational content, significantly advancing serious game design. While primarily aimed at enhancing Codebreakers, this new game contributes substantially to serious game theory by successfully implementing personalised learning within an engaging format. The project showcases the potential of knowledge tracing algorithms in creating adaptive, student-centered learning experiences within the context of educational games.
105;A Proposed Learner's Data Model: Integrating Informal Learning and Enhancing Personalization and Interoperability;A learner profile is key to personalize learning content. Nowadays learners use different applications and tools to learn (Formal and informal types). Indeed, the diversity of profiles, their content, their structure, their operation, and the actors concerned, limits possible interoperability. Hence, the need for a rich and an interoperable learner profile that describes all previous learning achievements or experiences. In this work, after a brief analysis of available standards in this area, an approach is proposed to build an interoperable learner model based on xAPI statements that combine the formal and informal experiences to enhance learning analytic and personalization. Then, we present a tool to transform collected data into our XML model proposed based on the IMS-LIP standard, and in the end, we explore his utility.
106;Conceptual clustering of university graduate students' trajectories using formal concept analysis: a case study in Lebanon;Due to the weak academic advising systems in most schools, students need assistance to explore universities/colleges and study fields that match their interests and future careers. Unfortunately, the orientation programs in most schools are not well designed to cater to students' varied needs. While career orientation programs are much needed at schools, a large number of Lebanese schools have not integrated such programs in their educational systems yet. Thus, this research focuses on developing a hybrid recommender system based on machine learning techniques. Our research focuses on the implementation of the formal concept analysis (FCA) to study university graduates' trajectories. This data mining technique is applied in knowledge presentation and data processing. FCA enables the discovery of hidden knowledge by using association rule mining and machine learning. The objective of this study is to discover the university graduates' trajectories and demonstrate the effectiveness of the FCA technique in data clustering.
107;Research Trends in Adaptive Online Learning: Systematic Literature Review (2011-2020);"With the improvement of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs, online learning has become a viable means for teaching and learning. Nonetheless, online learning is still facing various challenges. The challenges include lack of support and loneliness experienced by learners. Adaptive online learning is one of the means that researchers are proposing to support learners and reduce the loneliness they experience in online learning. Research in adaptive online learning has been on the rise. Though there are several review studies that have attempted to provide summaries of research and development happening in this area, there is still lack of a comprehensive and up-to-date review that looks at the aspects of adaptive online learning systems in terms of the learner characteristics being modelled, domain model, adaptation model, the various techniques used to achieve the various tasks in those models and the impact the adaptive online learning has on learning. This study therefore was initiated in order to fill this gap. The study was carried out using a systematic literature review methodology. A total of 59 articles were used in the study, drawn from six databases namely Science direct, IEEE explore, ACM, Emerald, Springer and Taylor and Francis. The results indicate that: the most used learner characteristic is learning style even though the use of learning knowledge is on the rise; there is a rise in the use of machine learning algorithms in learner modelling; learning content is the most common target for adaptation; rules is the most utilized method in the adaptation model; and most adaptive online learning have not been evaluated in terms of learning. There is therefore a need for evaluation of the developed adaptive online learning and more studies that utilize more than one learner characteristic as the basis for adaptation and those that use machine learning."
108;Edtech brokers and evidence governance: knowledge intermediaries in the education technology market;"New types of intermediary organisations are creating evidence to guide school practices and shape markets around education technologies. This article focuses on the practices through which edtech brokers - understood here as evidence-making organisations that mediate between the edtech industry, schools, policy and research centres - create edtech knowledge and evidence. When inserted into policy and practice through recommendation systems, platform reviews, rankings and badges, this knowledge has the potential to affect educational practices, policy implementation and investors' decision-making processes. Based on interviews and documentary sources, we identify three practices through which edtech brokers produce and circulate edtech evidence: (i) participatory processes of evidence-making; (ii) political navigations and (iii) market curation. Ultimately, edtech brokers govern, within and beyond their local contexts, what kinds of edtech evidence is produced and circulated. This evidence is intended to create novel types of consensus between industry, academia, government and schools, redefining the boundaries of public education and the private edtech sector in an increasingly digital age."
109;Unveiling AI Perceptions: How Student Attitudes Towards AI Shape AI Awareness, Usage, and Conceptions;This study examines the relationship between students' attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and both AI competence and conceptions. 176 UK university students completed a survey where they were asked to rate statements in relation to their attitudes towards AI, their AI competence and their conceptions about AI using 5-point Likert-type scales. In relation to AI competence, results indicate that affective attitudes predicted awareness and usage, leading to information avoidance and disengagement. Cognitive attitudes positively predicted AI awareness and usage. Behavioural attitudes, however, did not predict awareness or usage, suggesting that individuals may engage with AI technology without deeper understanding. For AI conceptions, behavioural attitudes were more closely linked to conceptions of AI in educational contexts. Positive behavioural attitudes predicted students' conceptions of AI's role in intelligent tutoring systems, retentions, drop-out reduction, recommendation systems, and personalised learning. In contrast, affective attitudes predicted conceptions of AI's use in classroom monitoring and performance prediction, while cognitive attitudes had little influence. These are areas educators can focus on when designing teaching \& assessment strategies in relation to AI.
110;Designing an IMS-LD Meta-Model of a New Smart Learning Management System;"The context of this work is that of designing an IMS-LD metamodel of an LMS. The approach is to first think about the conditions for creating an LMS between learners and designing the IT environment that supports this system. In this chapter, the authors try to adapt the IMS-LD model with a metamodel for LMS based on the hybridization between learning theories. This adaptation will go through three stages: first, the development of the meta-model of LMS; second, the study of the correspondence between the developed meta-model and IMS-LD model; and finally, their transformation to IMS-LD meta-model."
111;Modeling a New Smart Learning Management System Based on the EML;"The context of this work is that of designing an IMS-LD model for a new smart LMS. The work is specifically in the field or seeking to promote using information technology from a distance. The approach is to first think about the conditions for creating a real new smart LMS between learners and designing the IT environment that supports this LMS. In this chapter, the authors try to adapt the IMS-LD model with a new smart LMS based on traditional pedagogy, behaviorism, cognitivism, and social constructivism. This adaptation will go through three stages: first, the development of an LMS model; second, the study of the correspondence between the developed model and the IMS-LD model; finally, their transformation to the IMS-LD model."
112;A New Smart Recommendation System of Learning Management Systems;This chapter presents the functional and technical architecture of a recommendation system of free learning management systems that the authors have implemented to facilitate the choice of the most suitable LMS to meet the objectives, specifications, and criteria chosen by the institution. Thus, any random choice entails a loss of money, effort, and time loss for porters and device designers, and this is for various reasons (cost, utility, usability, etc.). Notably, this system takes into account more than 20 LMSs. The choice of these LMSs is based on a methodical and systemic approach that identifies the adequate criteria to the objectives and specifications chosen by the institution, depending on the objects and pedagogical tools related to the recommended teaching and learning device, to retain the most suitable LMS. This chapter is motivated by the desire to clarify and support users in their choice of the most suitable LMS to meet their needs and to get maximum benefit from the potential offered by technologies in pedagogy.
113;Prototyping a New Smart Learning Management System Based on the NoSQL;The context of this work is that of prototyping a disciplinary information space for a new LMS. The work is specifically in the field or seeking to promote, using information technology from a distance, a collective knowledge construction. The approach is to first think about the conditions for creating a real LMS between learners and designing the IT environment that supports this LMS. The authors chose to base on the hybridization between four learning theories as a basis for teaching this LMS, namely the traditional pedagogy, behaviorism, cognitivism, and social constructivism. These pedagogies have already proven themselves, mostly in learning situations in the classroom. The LMS consists of different activity spaces for teaching and learning activities. The authors limit themselves in this work to the prototyping of disciplinary information space for a new smart LMS based on IMS-LD, the NoSQL, MongoDB database, and the Symfony framework.
114;Empowering Education: Leveraging Clustering and Recommendations for Enhanced Student Insights;This paper introduces an unsupervised machine learning approach for student clustering and personalized recommendations in education. We employ the K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct student groups based on behavioral engagement metrics. Unlike previous studies that relied on predefined categories, our methodology validated the number of clusters using both the elbow method and silhouette analysis, which ensured an optimal grouping structure. The clustering phase served as a foundation for deriving insights into student learning behaviors. To assess the clustering quality, we applied the silhouette score to quantify intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation, which provided statistical validation for our approach. Following the clustering process, we developed a recommendation system based on the user-based nearest neighbors collaborative filtering approach. This system tailors educational strategies to the unique characteristics of each cluster, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes. Furthermore, we compared our methodology against alternative clustering and recommendation techniques to demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness. Our findings suggest that this combined clustering and recommendation framework offers a data-driven approach to personalized education, which can be extended beyond the KALBOARD360 dataset to other educational contexts. The overarching goal was to refine adaptive learning models that cater to the diverse needs of students, improving their academic success and participation.
115;AI-Based Virtual Classroom Simulator With a Recommendation System in Preservice Teacher Training During COVID-19;Teaching practicum is an essential component of any teacher training program. It usually involves theoretical knowledge related to content and teaching in general, classroom management strategies, and skills utilized when confronted with challenging situations. Distance learning tools may impact knowledge transfer. Using artificial intelligence-based virtual classrooms posed a challenge for pre-service teachers to address teaching and learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study addresses incorporating an artificial intelligence-based virtual classroom environment with a recommendation feature as an open-access software to help pre-service teachers develop their teaching skills. Also, the study addresses recommendations to support educators' professional development. Finally, further recommendations and future directions provide thought-provoking ideas for using artificial intelligence-based virtual settings for teaching.
116;Examining the Usability of e-Content in Different Forms for Increasing Digital Parenting Competencies;"A usability test during the development of learning material can reduce many usability problems. Furthermore, this can increase the quality and efficiency of the material. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of e-contents developed to increase parents' digital parenting competencies and awareness. In this study, a usability test was created for online content. Materials for video and visual aided written material usability were designed and used for this study, including an online content usability questionnaire. Field experts' opinions were taken, and usability tests were conducted with real users. Alexander (2013) developed these usability tests and adapted into Turkish by Peky \& uuml;rek and Y \& imath;ld \& imath;z-Durak (2021). This study follows usability principles to determine the usability of various online videos and visually supported materials to increase parents' digital parenting competencies and awareness. Usability test results were revealed through descriptive statistics. This research helps parents better understand the possibilities, potentials, and limitations in designing educational online content on digital parenting. On the other hand, this usability test has the potential to detect the usability of educational videos in different fields."
117;Learning Styles in University Students: Types of Strategies, Materials, Supports, Evaluation and Performance. Case Study;"The aim of this study is to identify different learning styles in university students in the frame of university teaching carried out through innovative proposals for work and research projects, with inverted classroom dynamics (active and cooperative) and adopting a formative assessment that focuses on both the process and the students' outcomes. This proposal is complemented by the objective of determining the influence of different learning styles on the preference for the type of performance in university teaching. A hypothetico-deductive methodological design for exploratory and correlational purposes was followed. The sample consisted of total of 640 participants in university degree courses. The data were gathered using a questionnaire that grouped 46 items into five double-response dimensions, determined by the preference or position held by the students regarding the learning strategies, methods and techniques applied; material or resources used to carry out the teaching, as well as the integration of information and communication technologies (ICT); type of supports that were received in the process; instruments to carry out the assessment; and lastly, individual or team academic performance. The outcomes show an x-ray of four models according to the student's learning styles: individual, cooperative, dependent and autonomous. These are identified with four clusters in the sample of students selected for the study, which are associated with practical, conventional, critical and efficient student models. The conclusions explain that there are no pure models, as there are nuances that connect them in real classroom practice, but the level of student preference helps to measure the impact and confirms the improvement in teaching through university work projects."
118;Drug Recommended System Based on Sentimental Analysis of Drug Reviews Using Machine Learning;The medical profession as a hole is in disarray, which has redounded in the deaths of a number of people. Due to a lack of vacuity, people began taking drug without consulting a croaker, causing their health to deteriorate faster than usual. Machine literacy has lately proven useful in a variety of operations, and there has been an increase in new work for robotization. Since the coronavirus emerged, it has become increasingly difficult to access licit clinical funding because to shortages of experts and healthcare personnel, appropriate attire and medication, etc. The whole medical community is tortured, which leads to the deaths of numerous beings. Due to attainability, people began taking drugs alone without necessary discussion, which made the health situation worse than normal. Recent times have seen an upsurge in inventive work for robotization, making machine literacy valuable in several procedures. Using colourful vectorization techniques like Bow, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Manual Feature Analysis, we create a drug recommendation system in this investigation that uses patient reviews to prognosticate the sentiment and can recommend the best medication for a given complaint by using various bracket algorithms.
119;Knowledge Tracing Through Enhanced Questions and Directed Learning Interaction Based on Multigraph Embeddings in Intelligent Tutoring Systems;In recent years, knowledge tracing (KT) within intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) has seen rapid development. KT aims to assess a student's knowledge state based on past performance and predict the correctness of the next question. Traditional KT often treats questions with different difficulty levels of the same concept as identical representations, limiting the effectiveness of question embedding. Additionally, higher-order semantic relationships between questions are overlooked. Graph models have been employed in KT to enhance question embedding representation, but they rarely consider the directed relationships between learning interactions. Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach, KT through Enhanced Questions and Directed Learning Interaction Based on multigraph embeddings in ITSs (MGEKT), to address these limitations. One channel enhances question embedding representation by capturing relationships between students, concepts, and questions. This channel defines two meta paths, facilitating the learning of high-order semantic relationships between questions. The other channel constructs a directed graph of learning interactions, leveraging graph attention convolution to illustrate their intricate relationships. A new gating mechanism is proposed to capture long-term dependencies and emphasize critical information when tracing students' knowledge states. Notably, MGEKT employs reverse knowledge distillation, transferring knowledge from two small models (student models) to a large model (teacher model). This knowledge distillation enhances the model's generalization performance and improves the perception of crucial information. In comparative evaluations across four datasets, MGEKT outperformed baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in KT.
120;Toward an Adaptive Educational Hypermedia System (AEHS-JS) based on the Overlay Modeling and Felder and Silverman's Learning Styles Model for Job Seekers;"In this paper we introduce a new design of an adaptive educational hypermedia system for job seekers, this proposal is based, for the part of learning objectives, on a job model which allows adapting the content and the path of education to the intended jobs, and, for the learner model construction, on a specific use of the learning styles of Felder and Silverman. First, we present existing literature to give a general review on adaptive educational hypermedia systems, in that way; we have reported the related items to different notions in the adaptive educational Systems area as the differentiated pedagogy, the learning objects, and the learner profile. Then we argued our choice of the components of our model and we detailed the new ones. As designed, the model can produce a suitable learning path for the user to match the job characteristics and the learning style of the person in order to help the user owning the job sought. With the possibility of linking the required competencies to the education skills, we aim to map business tasks to learning activities. Based on this approach, we designed an Adaptive Educational Hypermedia System named AEHS-JS that will help to improve the efficiency and pragmatism of job search activities. In plus of the social impact of this work as it help job seekers to complete their profiles and get the career they are looking for, this work will allow companies to find the candidates that match the job criteria sought."
121;A Competition-Oriented Student Team Building Method;There are many important and interesting academic competitions that attract an increasing number of students. However, traditional student team building methods usually have strong randomness or involve only some first-class students. To choose more suitable students to compose a team and improve students' abilities overall, a competition-oriented student team building method is proposed. This would not only lead to better competition results by choosing more suitable students and teams but also improve the overall involvement of students in considering education fairness. First, a Big Data platform is constructed to collect students' various behavior data. Based on that, a competition with a six-tuple attribute and a student with a six-tuple attribute are modeled. Then, a corresponding utility function is designed for each attribute in the student model to denote the student's utility in this attribute for attending a competition. Furthermore, a team utility function is developed for each team to denote the utilities of all involved students. A team building utility function is also developed to denote the utilities of all involved teams. Second, a multiple-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm with dimension by dimension improvement is proposed to build appropriate teams to optimize team building utility maximization and education fairness simultaneously. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the overall performance of our proposed team building method not only has better performance in terms of team utility and student ability than other current methods, but also has better performance in terms of hyper volume and inverted generational distance than other optimization algorithms.
122;Personalized Mobile Learning and Course Recommendation System;Mobile-based learning provides new experience to the learners to learn anything from anywhere and anytime by using their portable or mobile device. Vast educational contents and also different media formats can be supported by the mobile devices. Access speed of those materials has also improved a lot. With this advancement, providing required content or materials in the desired format to the learner is essential to the learning management system. Also, it is very important to guide the learner based on their interest in learning. With this outset, the proposed mobile learning system helps the learners to access different courses under different levels and different specializations. The course contents are in different formats called learning objects (LO). In order to provide personalized learning experience to the learner, the system finds the learner's preferences and selects the desired learning objects. It also recommends some specializations with level to the learners to achieve higher grades.
123;E-Learning Recommendation System for Big Data Based on Cloud Computing;In educational institutions, E-learning has been known as a successful technology for enhancing performance, concentration, and thus providing higher academic success. Nevertheless, the conventional system for executing research work and selecting courses is a time-consuming and unexciting practice, that not only directly impacts the students' academic achievement, but also impacts the learning experience of students. In addition to that, there is an enormous number of various kinds of data in the E-Learning domain both structured and unstructured, and the academic establishments attempt to manage and understand big complicated data sets. To fix this problem, this paper proposes a model of an E-learning recommendation system that will suggest and encourage the learner in choosing the courses according to their needs. This system used big data tools such as Hadoop and Spark in order to enhance data collection, storage, analysis, processing, optimization, and visualization, furthermore based on cloud computing infrastructure and especially Google cloud services.
124;An improved adaptive learning path recommendation model driven by real-time learning analytics;The advancements in the education sector made e-learning more popular in recent years. The velocity of learning content creation and its availability is also growing exponentially day after day. It is challenging for a learner to find a learning path for a course with a vast content repository. So, recommending a learning path helps the learners streamline the learning materials systematically and achieve their goals. This article proposes a learning path recommendation approach focused on knowledge building and learning performance analysis. The model considers both static and dynamic learner parameters for learning path generation. The difficulty level of the learning resources is tuned based on the real-time performance analysis of the students. The learning resources are recommended based on learning preferences and the ability of a learner to learn the specific learning resource. The model also predicts the learning time and the expected score for each learner. Root Mean Square Deviation and Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared error) measures are used to find the correctness of the prediction. The model is also checked for its adaptivity to the learners' changing behavior and diversity of the LOs recommended for different learners. Ninety-six undergraduate learners participated in the study. The experimentations are conducted with 530 LOs from selected courses. The comparison results with three existing models show a better performance from the proposed approach with an average accuracy rise of 30\% in learning path prediction based on the expected duration of learning 27.8\% in expected score prediction with the second-best performing model. It is observed that the real-time learning analytics using the implicit learner log data benefits the recommendation process. LO rating strongly indicated the enhancement of learner satisfaction and experience with a rise of 25.5\% when comparing the rating share with the second-best model.
125;A New Learning Path Model for E-Learning Systems;This work presents a new approach to the learning path model in e-learning systems. The model uses data from the database records from an e-learning system and uses graphs as representation. In this work, the authors show how the model can be used to represent visually the learning paths, behavior analysis, help to suggest group formation for collaborative activities, and thus assist the teacher in making decisions. To validate the practical utility of the model, the authors created two tools, one to visualize the learning paths and another to suggest groups of students for collaborative activities. Both tools were tested in a real environment, presenting useful results. The authors carried experiments with students from three programs: physics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Experiments show that it is possible to use the proposed learning path to analyze student behavior patterns and recommend group formation with positive results.
126;Learning Path Recommendation System for Programming Education Based on Neural Networks;Programming education has recently received increased attention due to growing demand for programming and information technology skills. However, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting this demand. One way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. This article proposes a learning path recommendation system that applies a recurrent neural network to a learner's ability chart, which displays the learner's scores. In brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner's submission history using a trial-and-error process, and the learner's ability chart is used as an indicator of their current knowledge. An approach for constructing a learning path recommendation system using ability charts and its implementation based on a sequential prediction model and a recurrent neural network, are presented. Experimental evaluation is conducted with data from an e-learning system.
127;Virtual book clubs in Spain: their participants and their functioning;This article analyses virtual reading clubs in operation in Spain in 2019. The objective was to obtain an idea of how these virtual clubs work, the technological platforms used and the operating rules, and also to examine the composition of their memberships: their sociodemographic profile, motivations, experiences, and evaluations. To this end, we carried out a review of studies and experiences of clubs of this type in Spain and then contacted 103 institutions, including public libraries and universities, in order to identify projects currently under-way throughout the country. We were able to identify 24 virtual reading clubs, which we contacted once again to carry out our study. The conclusions shed light on the activities organized to encourage reading in Spain: the groups present a diverse set of operating rules and platforms, but the user profile is homogeneous and the assessments made by its participants are positive. These conclusions may help to identify good practices and may help to guide the design of new virtual reading clubs and the reorientation of those already in operation. The arrival of COVID-19 and the possible need to transform face-to-face reading clubs into virtual ones, will oblige these institutions to consider expanding the range of virtual activities on offer.
128;Adaptive learning in computer science education: A scoping review;Adaptive learning is a teaching approach aiming to personalize the learning experience for each student. In Computer Science Education (CSE), Adaptive Learning Systems (ALS) can provide students with customized lessons, exercises, and assessments based on their previous knowledge, strengths, and weaknesses. Some literature reviews focus on adaptive learning techniques, but none specifically analyze the methods used in adaptive systems in CSE. Our overall objective is to identify the computing techniques that are implemented within ALS to provide adaptive computer education in higher education. We conducted a scoping review (SR) based on the Guidelines for performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering, defining six research questions and a search string. We performed searches in four databases, retrieving 512 documents. After applying the selection criteria, we selected 29 works. The results present quantitative and qualitative data from those 29 studies. Most research has used adaptive learning in programming education (12 articles) and databases (9 papers). Nine articles used learning styles as the core of adaptation, with the Felder-Silverman model being used by seven of them. The most commonly used approach was the rule-based system approach built by experts within the proposal, which was used in 17.24\% of the articles. Clustering, collaborative filtering, fuzzy logic, and K-NN were used in 10.34\% of the proposals. The positive aspect of ``delivering adaptive content '' was pointed out in seven articles. As for negative aspects, the problem of lack of student engagement was mentioned in four articles. This study discusses the application of dynamic and static models based on learning styles (LS) and the challenges involved in their use. Additionally, another aspect pointed out is that it is crucial to carefully consider pedagogical aspects in learning systems and have mixed development teams. The study also discusses student motivation and the use of gamification elements as a strategy to engage students in electronic learning systems. Finally, the results also indicate that the level of student knowledge is typically represented by a student model (SM), and the growing trend is the use of hybrid SMs. The research identified the most studied areas in ALS in CSE, such as computer programming and databases. The most common techniques used in ALS were rule-based systems built by experts, fuzzy logic, and clustering. The most common feature of ALS identified was learning resources, and the majority of studies focused on investigating the impact of system accuracy. This research can help researchers design better adaptive learning systems and understand challenges that need to be addressed.
129;CARIA : A Personalized Career Recommender Based on Individual Competency Similarity Measure;The purpose of this research is to create a personalized system called CARIA that suggests career recommendations based on students' competencies and the required skills in each career. The focus of this study is on digital technology and digital media careers. The personalized career recommender system uses a novel similarity measure called modified Euclidean similarity to evaluate its performance and compare it with other similarity measures, machine learning, and GPT-4 techniques. The experimental results showed that modified Euclidean similarity achieved a precision@10 score of 0.83, which outperformed other techniques. The main objective of CARIA is to provide students with suitable career paths and conduct a competency gap analysis. This helps students choose a career path that fits their abilities. This research contributes to education in digital technology, digital media, and the workforce by providing employees with competencies that align with their needs.
130;Short-term and long-term learners' motivation modeling in Web-based educational systems;Purpose Short-term motivation encompasses specific, challenging and attainable goals that develop in the limited timespan. On the other hand, long-term motivation indicates a sort of continuing commitment that is required to complete assigned task. As short-term motivational problems span for a limited period of time, such as a session, therefore, they need to be addressed in real time to keep the learner engaged in the learning process. Similarly, long-term learners' motivation plays an equally important role to retain the learner in the long run and minimize the risk of dropout. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to incorporate a comprehensive learner motivation model that is based on short-term and long-term aspects of the learners' motivation. This approach enables Web-based educational systems to identify the real-time motivational state of the learner and provide personalized interventions to keep the learners engaged in learning process. Design/methodology/approach Recent research regarding personalized Web-based educational systems demonstrates learner's motivation to be an essential component of the learning model. This is because of the fact that low motivation results in either students' less engagement or complete drop out from the learning activities. A learner motivation model is considered to be a set of perceptions and beliefs that the system has developed about a learner. This includes both short-term and long-term motivations of leaners. Findings This study proposed a framework of a domain independent learners' motivation model based on firm educational theories. The proposed framework consists of two modules. The primary module deals with real-time identification of motivation and logging off activities such as login, forum participation and adherence to assessment deadline. Secondary module maintains the profile of leaners associated with both short-term and long-term motivation. A study was conducted to verify the impact of learners' motivation model and personalized interventional strategies based on proposed model, using Systematical Information Education Method assessment standards. The results show an increase in motivational index and the characteristics associated with motivation during the conducted study. Originality/value Motivational diagnosis is important for both traditional classrooms and Web-based education systems. It is one of the major elements that contribute in the success of the learning process. However, dropout rate among online students is very high, which leads to incorporate motivational elements in more personalized way because motivated students will retain the course until they successfully complete it. Hence, identifying learner's motivation, updating learners' motivation model based on this identification and providing personalized interventions are the key for the success of Web-based educational systems.
131;Agriculture-Crop Recommendation System Based on Productivity and Season;India is an husbandry grounded frugality whose utmost of the GDP comes from husbandry. The provocation of this design comes from the adding self-murder rates in growers which may be due to low crop in crops. Climate and other environmental changes have come a major trouble in the husbandry field. Machine literacy is an essential approach for achieving practical and effective results for this problem. Predicting yield of the crop from literal available data like Rainfall, soil, downfall parameters and major crop yield. We achieved this using the machine learning algorithm. We did a relative study of colorful machine learning algorithms, i.e., ANN, K Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, SVM and Linear Retrogression and chose Random Forest Algorithm which gave an delicacy of 95. In this design a mobile operation has been developed which predicts the crop yield in general and also for a particular crop. Along with that, it also suggests the stoner if it is the right time to use the toxin or not.
132;A Personalized Matching System for Management Teaching Resources Based on Collaborative Filtering Algorithm;"To realize education informatization, it is highly necessary to recommend teaching resources to students that can enhance their learning interest and improve teaching quality. This paper develops a personalized matching system for management teaching resources based on collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm. Firstly, the authors set up a user interest model, designed the flow and algorithm for personalized matching, and improved the similarity calculation method. Next, a personalized recommendation algorithm was developed based on the CF, and a personalized matching engine was constructed with the aid of Apache Mahout. The experimental results show that the proposed CF algorithm can effectively improve the recommendation quality, and push personalized teaching resources to each user; the learners are highly satisfied with the personalized matching system. The research results shed new light on personalized recommendation of teaching resources, opening up a new way to education informatization."
133;Ontology-Based Recommender System for a Learning Sequence in Programming Languages;The same learning process in educational systems could be boring and time consuming for some learners. This problem arises from the lack of personalized learning sequence for learners with different knowledge level. Recommender systems play an important role in assisting the learners to find suitable learning materials and personalized learning sequence. Use of ontology for knowledge representation in knowledge-based recommender systems would facilitate sharing, reuse and common terminology. Since programming concepts have logical relationships among together so, traditional education systems are more stressful and very time-consuming. This paper aims to propose an ontology-based recommender system to present a Personalized Learning Sequence in Programming (PLSP) domain which is depended to learner's knowledge level. A recommender module and, the knowledge base module are integrated together in the proposed framework. The recommender module as the main module in the framework, has three stages which is working based on semantic rules and ontology representation. Evaluation of the system was carried out by comparing the non-recommender system (web-based search) using 32 ICT respondents. Results demonstrate that the participants who used the proposed system spent 1119 seconds to find the suitable learning path in comparison to those who used a non-recommender system (3480 seconds) in the same learning material. It means that learners who follow learning path with PLSP, are more suitable for them. Furthermore, the average mean value of usability test is 4.47, (5 maximum scale) which indicates that the system proved to be useful, was easy to use, and satisfied the users.
134;Gender differences and transferring knowledge in database modeling;"Background and ContextGender research shows that women are better at reading comprehension. Other studies indicate a lower tendency in women to choose STEM professions. Since data modeling requires reading skills and also belongs in the areas of information systems and computer science (STEM professions), these findings provoked our curiosity.ObjectiveComparing student modeling errors across different error categories; Finding out whether learning the notations of one type of modeling, class diagram (CD), leads to fewer modeling errors in the next type, entity-relationship diagram (ERD); Finding out whether the reading advantage of women would manifest within a STEM activity of database modeling.MethodWe conducted a within-subject design experiment with college students. We manipulated the modeling type, which is a CD or an ERD, and observed its impact on the type and number of errors in modeling tasks.FindingsCertain modeling aspects that are at a higher level of abstraction are much more prone to errors. Male students made more errors. There is a learning effect from one type of model to the other. Female students had much more significant learning from one model to the other.ImplicationsEducators should invest time and effort into applying modeling activities where the error rate is higher. Since female students have an advantage over male students in several modeling aspects, it is further proof that female students' lack of propensity for the STEM professions is based on a perceptual barrier regarding their ability to succeed and not on an inferiority in these domains."
135;Agri Farm: Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System for High Yield Farming Using Machine Learning Algorithms;Farmers have had a tough time selecting the correct crop for the correct season in recent years due to quick and abrupt changes in weather conditions. They eventually cannot produce enough to feed their family, forcing them to make decisions such as committing suicide. A crop and fertilizer recommendation system solves this problem by assessing several characteristics in the soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels, as well as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, and predicting the best crop for a specific field It can also predict the most suitable fertilizer if the soil nutrients are low for a specific crop based on the above parameters and also soil type, moisture content in soil. Machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes and Decision Tree are employed for the crop prediction.
136;Beyond Good AI: The Need for Sound Learning Theories in AIED;I nudge reevaluation of the idea that artificial intelligence for education (AIED) is merely about using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to automate understanding and responding to learning processes. Instead, I advocate for a human-centered approach to AIED that emphasizes the importance of personal connections, relationship-building, and scaffolding that goes beyond simplifying tasks to push students in their critical thinking. This approach calls for curating multimodal data from ecologically valid learning settings to train AIED systems, and maintaining flexibility in expectations around rational learner behavior when analyzing data from such systems. Given that the definition of good AIED is often discipline-specific and influenced by the underlying pedagogical models of student learning, the article calls on learning sciences researchers to integrate their complementary yet often competing theoretical lenses in rigorously studying AI-supported learning phenomena at scale.
137;Supporting knowledge monitoring ability: open learner modeling vs. open social learner modeling;Research has demonstrated that people generally think both their knowledge and performance levels are greater than they are. Although several studies have suggested that knowledge and progress visualization offered by open learner modeling (OLM) technology might influence students' self-awareness in a positive way, insufficient evidence exists to show that this is the case. This paper examines the effects of open learner modeling and its extension with social comparison features, known as open social learner modeling (OSLM), on students' knowledge monitoring abilities. We report the results of two semester-long classroom studies, using subjects who were undergraduate and graduate students in Java Programming and Database Management courses at the University of Pittsburgh. During their studies, the students were able to use different versions of an online practice system equipped with both OLM and OSLM. The students' knowledge monitoring abilities were examined in two ways: through absolute and relative assessments. According to the results, although in both OLM and OSLM groups the students' absolute knowledge monitoring ability increased during the semester-long study, relative self-assessment ability (i.e., their ability to compare their own knowledge levels with the knowledge levels of their peers) only increased in the OSLM group. The authors also traced relationships between the students' academic achievement and their absolute and relative knowledge monitoring abilities.
138;Towards an Approach Based on Adjusted Genetic Algorithms to Improve the Quantity of Existing Data in the Context of Social Learning;In the current era, multiple disciplines struggle with the scarcity of data, particularly in the area of e-learning and social learning. In order to test their approaches and their recommendation systems, researchers need to ensure the availability of large databases. Nevertheless, it is sometimes challenging to find-out large scale databases, particularly in terms of education and e-learning. In this article, we outline a potential solution to this challenge intended to improve the quantity of an existing database. In this respect, we suggest genetic algorithms with some adjustments to enhance the size of an initial database as long as the generated data owns the same features and properties of the initial database. In this case, testing machine learning and recommendation system approaches will be more practical and relevant. The test is carried out on two databases to prove the efficiency of genetic algorithms and to compare the structure of the initial databases with the generated databases. The result reveals that genetic algorithms can achieve a high performance to improve the quantity of existing data and to solve the problem of data scarcity.
139;Towards an Evolution of E-Learning Recommendation Systems: From 2000 to Nowadays;In e-learning, recommendation systems have proven to be highly efficient for improving learners' performance and knowledge. They can manage the different pedagogical resources and simplify the workload for the instructor and learners as well. Throughout the years, recommendation systems in e-learning have witnessed a major evolution since the 2000s. Several aspects have been developed, including techniques involved, test data (...). In this respect, this paper analyses the evolution of recommendation systems in e-learning since 2000 with a focus on the evolution sides. It furthermore addresses areas not fully addressed to date. A set of recommendation systems is identified and then analysed in order to define techniques used, as well as algorithms deployed.
140;Identification of Malicious Injection Attacks in Dense Rating and Co Visitation Behaviors;Personalized recommender systems are pervasive in different domains, ranging from e-commerce services, financial transaction systems to social networks. The generated ratings and reviews by users toward products are not only favourable to make targeted improvements on the products for online businesses, but also beneficial for other users to get a more insightful review of the products. In reality, recommender systems can also be deliberately manipulated by malicious users due to their fundamental vulnerabilities and openness. However, improving the detection performance for defending malicious threats including profile injection attacks and covisitation injection attacks is constrained by the challenging issues. Various styles of malicious attacks in real-global facts coexist, it's far hard to stability the commonality and speciality of score behaviors in phrases of correct detection and score behaviors between attackers and anchor customers because of the consistency of assault intentions are extraordinarily similar. To stumble on this assault an green device getting to know algorithm has been carried out which evaluation massive datasets for powerful detection of assault. Parameters which can be to be had in datasets which include Docid, Label,Rating, Verified\_ Purchase, Product\_Category,Product\_Id,Product\_Title,Review\_Title And Review\_Text. Based at the dataset whether or not the product is bought with the aid of using unique person is proven and the overview is associated with wonderful or poor are analyzed in case the person is real. If a faux customers supplying score or overview will be diagnosed correctly with the aid of using Naive bayes classifier. Hence our technique protects person non-public records loss and misbehaving activities. Our proposed technique achieves most overall performance as compared to different current to be had methods.
141;Personality aware Product Recommendation System based on User Interests Mining and Meta path Discovery;Any contemporary online retail or social network platform must have a recommendation mechanism. Traditional product recommendation systems have two key flaws: redundant recommendations and an unpredictable response to new products (cold start). Since the old recommendation algorithms depend only on historical purchase behaviour to propose new things, these drawbacks are inevitable. Personal characteristics of the user, such as personality traits and areas of interest, might be used to reduce the ``cold start '' and eliminate redundant recommendations. Meta-Interest, a personality-aware product recommendation system based on user interest mining and meta-path discovery, has been proposed in this study. If the user's history does not include these or comparable things, Meta-Interest can anticipate the user's interest and the objects linked with this interest. Analyzing the user's interests and then recommending things that match those interests is how this is done. Two components of the suggested system take into account the user's personality features: it predicts his areas of interest based on those qualities and it matches the user's personality facets with the objects that go along with those facets. Deep-learning recommendation systems and session-based recommendation systems were put up against the suggested system. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed strategy may improve the accuracy and recall of the recommendation system, particularly in cold start situations.
142;Teaching tactics supporting beginner modelling in upper secondary;During lesson implementation teachers employ teaching tactics to facilitate student modelling. Teaching tactics refer to the specific in-the-moment pedagogical purpose of teachers' actions rather than how they are undertaken. Research at upper secondary level is required to determine how teaching tactics underpin the enactment management tactics of student groups learning to model independently in regular classes. The research questions addressed in this study are: (1) What evidence is there for specific teaching tactics being used by upper secondary mathematics teachers as they implement mathematical modelling tasks with Year 11 students working in small groups in their regular classes? (2) Based on student response to use of specific teaching tactics, what was the uptake of support and consequences for their modelling? We analysed data, purposively selected from 11 modelling implementations by 5 Year 11 teachers. Nine teaching tactics, previously identified in a Year 10 modelling classroom, were applied by the teachers. Two of three tactics associated with developing students' anticipatory capabilities were used sparingly, but all teachers promoted foreshadowing and feeding back. Analysis of student responses and uptake of support showed most tactics were applied but not all readily taken up by groups to manage their modelling.
143;Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Healthcare Services Efficiency;The article is dedicated to the problem of assessing the quality of healthcare using machine learning algorithms. It is proposed to evaluate categorical term ``healthcare quality '' as discrete variable on the basis of data on treatment result, provided by one of the major hospitals in Russia. Preliminary analysis of both dependent and explanatory variables is provided. The statistics of results of treatment depending on the age and gender of patients are analyzed. The necessity of reducing the initial dataset is justified. The ways of correction the imbalance in dataset is proposed, such as SMOTE and Tomek Links On the basis of corrected data ordered logit and Random Forest models were designed. The comparative analysis of various models is presented. The drawbacks of each model are explained. The ordered logit model on balanced data allowed to determine factors, that have greatest positive impact on the treatment result as well as Random Forest model made the predictions as accurate as it is possible. On the basis of results obtained, the recommendations to improve the healthcare efficiency in the framework of particular hospital are made.
144;Students' Struggles with Emi in Kazakhstan, Universities;Introduction. Fascination with English medium instruction (EMI) is fast growing in higher education institutions in non-native English-speaking countries, including Kazakhstan. The Kazakhstani government adopted a trilingual education policy in 2007 and the Bologna Process in 2010. Both these initiatives motivated universities to offer academic programmes in the English language. As a result, EMI programmes are offered in over 70 higher education institutions across Kazakhstan. In addition, there are four major Kazakhstani universities which offer academic programmes in English only. Despite the increase in the number of EMI programmes, there is a lack of empirical evidence about the difficulties and challenges faced by students in the EMI programmes. Aim. The present study aimed to investigate the nature, forms, and levels of challenges graduate students face in academic reading and writing in English and the way they cope with these challenges. The study was conducted with graduate students and faculty in 10 selected Kazaklistani universities, which offer academic programmes in EMI. Research methodology and methods. The study is based on a mixed-method design, involving an online survey and semi-structured interviews. The closed-ended questions have been analysed using SPSS software (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). The grounded theory analysis was utilised to scrutinise open-ended questions and interview transcripts. Results and scientific novelty. The study's results indicated two major challenges faced by graduate students in academic reading and writing: the personal-psychological challenge and sociological challenge. The first challenge includes students' previous academic backgrounds, exposure, and learning experiences. The second challenge is related to English academic culture and students' worldviews, concepts, and values about English as a language and medium of instruction. As a result, graduate students experienced a lack of vocabulary, inadequate academic literacy skills, unfamiliarity with academic writing styles in English, and lack of skills to synthesise reading materials. Practical significance. Hence, this study recommends systematising English language programmes across secondary and higher education institutions to help students acquire advanced English language proficiency. Also, the study results suggest that local faculty members should be trained according to international standards in terms of their English language skills and innovative teaching methods.
145;Personality-based tailored explainable recommendation for trustworthy smart learning system in the age of artificial intelligence;In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), trust in AI systems is becoming more important. Explainable recommenders, which explain why an item is recommended, have recently been proposed in the field of learning technology to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, the methods for generating explanations are limited and do not consider the learner's cognitive perceptions or personality. This study draws inspiration from tailored intervention research in public health and investigates the effectiveness of personality-based tailored explanations by implementing them for the recommended quizzes in an explainable recommender system. High school students (n = 217) were clustered into three distinct profiles labeled Diligent (n = 77), Fearful (n = 72), and Agreeable (n = 68), based on the Big Five personality traits. The students were divided into a tailored intervention group (n = 106) and a control group (n = 111). In the tailored intervention group, personalized explanations for recommended quizzes were provided based on student profiles, with explanations based on quiz characteristics. In the control group, only non-personalized explanations based on quiz characteristics were provided. An 18-day A/B experiment showed that the tailored intervention group had significantly higher recommendation usage than the control group. These results suggest that personality-based tailored explanations with a recommender approach are effective for e-learning engagement and imply improved trustworthiness of AI learning systems.
146;Evaluating the Effectiveness of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model-Based Explainable Recommender;Explainable recommendation, which provides an explanation about why a quiz is recommended, helps to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, little research examined the effectiveness of the explainable recommender, especially on academic performance. To survey its effectiveness, the authors evaluate the math academic performance among middle school students (n=115) by giving pre- and post-test questions based evaluation techniques. During the pre- and post-test periods, students were encouraged to use the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model based explainable recommendation system. To evaluate how well the students were able to do what they could not do, the authors defined growth rate and found recommended quiz clicked counts had a positive effect on the total number of solved quizzes (R=0.343, P=0.005) and growth rate (R=0.297, P=0.017) despite no correlation between the total number of solved quizzes and growth rate. The results suggest that the use of an explainable recommendation system that learns efficiently will enable students to do what they could not do before.
147;Explainable eBook recommendation for extensive reading in K-12 EFL learning;An automatic recommendation system for learning materials in e-learning addresses the challenge of selecting appropriate materials amid information overload and varying self-directed learning (SDL) skills. Such systems can enhance learning by providing personalized recommendations. In Extensive Reading (ER) for English as a Foreign Language (EFL), recommending materials is crucial due to the paradox that learners with low SDL skills struggle to select suitable ER resources, despite ER's potential to improve SDL. Additionally, determining the difficulty level of ER materials and assessing learners' progress remains challenging. The system must also explain its recommendations to foster motivation and trust. This study proposes a mechanism to estimate the difficulty of ER materials, adapted to learner preferences, using information retrieval techniques, and an explainable recommendation system for English materials. An experiment was conducted with 240 Japanese junior high school students in an ER program to assess the accuracy of difficulty estimation and identify learner characteristics receptive to the recommendations. While the recommendations did not significantly impact learners' English skills or motivation, they were positively received. A strong relationship was found between the use and acceptance of recommendations and learners' motivation. The study suggests that although the system did not increase overall motivation, it has potential to further enhance the motivation of naturally motivated learners.
148;Generative artificial intelligence in education: A topic-based bibliometric analysis;Information and communication technologies have transformed education, driving it towards intelligent teaching and learning. With the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI), represented by tools such as ChatGPT, there is also a growing body of literature on generative AI in education. In this study, we searched the Scopus, ERIC, and Web of Science databases as well as the proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education and the International Conference on Educational Data Mining. These searches yielded 1,158 papers that we subjected to topic modelling analysis, the Mann-Kendall trend test, and keyword analysis to comprehensively review the evolving trends and dynamics of generative AI in education, active publication sources and authors, major research topics in generative AI education, and potential directions for cross-thematic research. We analysed the trends of keywords and relevance during different sub-periods. Topic modelling enabled us to classify all abstracts of the reviewed papers into 12 topics and identify the tendency of each topic. The topics included predicting student performance, learning tutoring systems, generative AI and AI literacy, writing/essay automated grading, chatbot-based learning/assessment, gamified/game-based learning \& AI learning environments, emotional engagement, automatic feedback, question generation, generative AI use in peer assessment, personalised recommendation system, and simulation-based study environment. Finally, a heat map and a hierarchy cluster provided information about the correlations between topics and the potential integration of different research directions for generative AI in education, offering a reference for future research.
149;Co-ML: Collaborative Machine Learning Model Building for Developing Dataset Design Practices;Machine learning (ML) models are fundamentally shaped by data, and building inclusive ML systems requires significant considerations around how to design representative datasets. Yet, few novice-oriented ML modeling tools are designed to foster hands-on learning of dataset design practices, including how to design for data diversity and inspect for data quality. To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13-18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students' attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.
150;Personal learning material recommendation system for MOOCs based on the LSTM neural network;"Massive open online courses (MOOCs; online courses delivered over the Internet) enable distance learning without time and place constraints. MOOCs are popular; however, active participation level among students who take MOOCs is generally lower than that among students who take in -person courses. Students who take MOOCs often lack guidance, and the courses often fail to provide personalized learning materials. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to manage increasing amounts of learning data in learners' online activity records. Driven by the trend in big data, AI technology has drawn increasing attention in various fields. AI -based recommendation systems (RSs) are powerful tools for improving resource acquisition through supply customization, and they can provide personalized learning materials as study guides. In this study, a personalized learning path for MOOCs based on long short-term memory (LSTM) was proposed to meet students' personal needs for learning. According to students' video -watching behaviors, we proposed an MOOC material RS that identifies students with similar learning behaviors through clustering and then uses the clustering results and the learning paths of each group of students to construct an LSTM model to recommend learning paths. The system's learning path recommendations can effectively improve the online participation of learners, and students who received recommendations progressed from the slow -progress group to the medium -progress or fast -progress group. In addition, the learning attitude questionnaire results indicated that the proposed system not only motivated learners to continue learning and achieve high learning capacity but also supported their study planning according to their individual learning needs."
151;Learner Perceptions of AI-Powered Learning Portfolios and Personalized Material Recommendation Mechanisms in Reinforcement Learning Algorithms;The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated alternative pedagogical approaches, with online autonomous learning courses emerging as a viable method for compiling learning portfolios. Consequently, online autonomous learning has garnered increasing scholarly attention. Embodying principles of openness and transcending temporal and spatial constraints, online courses afforded global learners opportunities for continued education during the pandemic. Online courses facilitate enhanced online interaction among students and teachers and allow students to control their learning experience (learner autonomy) and pace. Nevertheless, online autonomous learning presents fundamental challenges. Notably, in the absence of direct teacher and teaching assistant supervision, online autonomous learning tends to lead to lower completion rates and higher dropout rates, concerns currently under investigation by numerous researchers. In contrast to traditional teacher-centered models, online autonomous learning courses prioritize self-directed learning. Learners independently establish learning objectives and strategies commensurate with their personal learning levels to master course content. Through a series of instructional videos, in-class exercises, discussion forums, and other interactive features, an appropriate self-regulated learning mechanism was developed to guide learners toward effective autonomous learning. The exponential growth of big data in recent years has positioned artificial intelligence as focal point of inquiry across various fields. Machine learning has catalyzed substantial advancements in the field of data science. The accumulation of extensive learning generates substantial volumes of structured and unstructured data, including the personal information of learners and various learning metrics. A growing body of research advocates for the use of data analytics as a viable method to optimize online and adaptive learning processes. Learning diagnosis entail learners' self-assessment of requisite capabilities for learning tasks and comparative analyses of capabilities against domain expert-established concept structures by employing relevant question parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination. To facilitate this, an automated artificial intelligence material recommendation mechanism was developed, underpinned by several machine learning models. By observing online user learning behavior patterns, learning data and indicators were formulated, enabling the analysis of various online learning behaviors (e.g., watching videos and answering practice questions) and the generation of learning processes that can be viewed by learners. A practice question recommendation mechanism combined with an instant messaging application (LINE) was designed, leveraging teacher-created knowledge maps to assess students' mastery of concepts. Zimmerman's cyclical model of self-regulation served as the foundational framework for the recommendation mechanism. A quasiexperimental research design was employed. Participants were recruited from a calculus course taught at a university in northern Taiwan. An experimental group used reinforcement learning - recommended practice questions for self-evaluation, and a control group received randomly assigned questions. Significant improvements in scores were observed in the experimental group, and greater learning stickiness was observed compared with the control group. Consistent percentile rank increases following practice question completion suggest the system's capacity to deliver personalized recommendations on the basis of individual differences, thereby facilitating concept-specific feedback and adaptive learning. This, in turn, fostered increased teacher-student interaction, mitigated learner isolation, and increased learning motivation, thereby strengthening self-regulated learning abilities. Upon course completion, the participants could autonomously generate artificial intelligence learning portfolios through the system on the basis of diagnostic results, creating a comprehensive record of their learning performance. These portfolios facilitated the elucidation of learner mastery levels through the accumulation of extensive learning data (big data) on the platform. A postcourse self-regulated learning questionnaire survey revealed a positive participant perception of the materialrecommendation mechanism and generated artificial intelligence learning portfolio. The participants demonstrated strong positive attitudes toward system reliability, learning attitudes, and metacognition but low perceptions of system utility, and low overall usage rates. Enhancing usage incentive, continuously refining the accuracy of the recommendation system's algorithms, and conducting comparative analyses with existing systems are essential to improve the recommendation system's perceived utility.
152;Knowledge Annotation for Intelligent Textbooks;With the increased popularity of electronic textbooks, there is a growing interest in developing a new generation of ``intelligent textbooks, '' which have the ability to guide readers according to their learning goals and current knowledge. Intelligent textbooks extend regular textbooks by integrating machine-manipulable knowledge, and the most popular type of integrated knowledge is a list of relevant concepts mentioned in the textbooks. With these concepts, multiple intelligent operations, such as content linking, content recommendation, or student modeling, can be performed. However, existing automatic keyphrase extraction methods, even supervised ones, cannot deliver sufficient accuracy to be practically useful in this task. Manual annotation by experts has been demonstrated to be a preferred approach for producing high-quality labeled data for training supervised models. However, most researchers in the education domain still consider the concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than a carefully executed task, which can result in low-quality annotated data. Using the annotation of concepts for the Introduction to Information Retrieval textbook as a case study, this paper presents a knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations. As demonstrated by the data we collected, the inter-annotator agreement gradually increased along with our procedure, and the concept annotations we produced led to better results in document linking and student modeling tasks. The contributions of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a codebook for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations for the target textbook, which could be used as a gold standard in further intelligent textbook research.
153;Selection of Audio Learning Resources Based on Big Data;Currently, audio learning resources account for a large proportion of the total online learning resources. Designing and implementing a method for optimizing and selecting audio learning resources based on big data of education will be of great significance to the recommendation of learning resources. Therefore, this paper studies a method for selecting audio learning resources based on the big data of education, with music learning as an example. First, the audio signals were converted into mel spectrograms, and accordingly, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features of audio learning resources were obtained. Then, on the basis of the conventional content-based audio recommendation algorithm, the established interest degree vector of target students with respect to music learning was expanded, and a collaborative filtering hybrid algorithm for audio learning resources that incorporates the interest degrees of neighbouring students was proposed, which effectively improved the accuracy and stability in the prediction of students' interest in music learning. Finally, the experimental results verified the feasibility and prediction accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
154;Interpretable Cognitive State Prediction via Temporal Fuzzy Cognitive Map;"Understanding student cognitive states is essential for assessing human learning. The deep neural networks (DNN)-inspired cognitive state prediction method improved prediction performance significantly; however, the lack of explainability with DNNs and the unitary scoring approach fail to reveal the factors influencing human learning. Identifying and understanding these factors remain a challenge. Thus, this article proposes the temporal fuzzy cognitive map (tFCM) model, which combines the prediction power of DNNs with the interpretability of fuzzy cognitive maps. In the proposed tFCM model, cognitive states are modeled as fuzzy, multidimensional, and interrelated vectors, which are input to a long short-term memory network for prediction. This integration allows the proposed model to combine the exceptional ability of DNNs to uncover latent factors with the distinct benefits of fuzzy cognitive maps' ability to reveal potential correlations. A comparative experiment was designed and conducted on a large-scale dataset to assess the predictive performance and interpretability of the proposed tFCM model. The results demonstrate tFCM's superior performance and interpretability compared to existing models. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a multidimensional quantitative model to represent cognitive states and an interpretable model architecture for state prediction."
155;A duplex adaptation mechanism in the personalized learning environment;The implementation of personalized learning environments presents a complex challenge in continuously analyzing the learning process and customizing instructional content for individual students. In response to this challenge, this study introduces a duplex adaptation mechanism. This innovative approach recommends learning content based on individual students' prior knowledge and concurrently adjusts learning activities according to their ongoing behavior. The mechanism was integrated within a personalized learning system focused on digital literacy. An empirical study, involving a sample of 336 secondary school students, was conducted to assess the impact of this approach on learning motivation and achievement. The findings reveal a significant enhancement in both student motivation and academic performance when compared to traditional methods. Most notably, the students expressed a marked preference for this duplex mechanism. This study provides a pivotal contribution to understanding the multi-dimensional benefits of such adaptive learning mechanisms and highlights the potential for its further application in personalized learning environments.
156;Empowering Instructors With AI: Evaluating the Impact of an AI-Driven Feedback Tool in Learning Analytics;Providing timely and personalized feedback on open-ended student responses is a challenge in education due to the increased workloads and time constraints educators face. While existing research has explored how learning analytic approaches can support feedback provision, previous studies have not sufficiently investigated educators' perspectives of how these strategies affect the assessment process. This article reports on the findings of a study that aimed to evaluate the impact of an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform designed to assist educators in the assessment and feedback process. Leveraging large language models and learning analytics, the platform supports educators by offering tag-based recommendations and AI-generated feedback to enhance the quality and efficiency of open-response evaluations. A controlled experiment involving 65 higher education instructors assessed the platform's effectiveness in real-world environments. Using the technology acceptance model, this study investigated the platform's usefulness and relevance from the instructors' perspectives. Moreover, we collected data from the platform's usage to identify partners in instructors' behavior for different scenarios. Results indicate that AI-driven feedback significantly improved instructors' ability to provide detailed personalized feedback in less time. This study contributes to the growing research on AI applications in educational assessment and highlights key considerations for adopting AI-driven tools in instructional settings.
157;How Do AI Technologies Augment Intelligent Information Services in Libraries? A Deep Learning-Based Topic Modeling and Temporal Analysis;Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming library information services by enhancing user interaction, resource management, and academic support. However, fine-grained topic identification and evolution analysis in this field remain underexplored. This study identifies key research topics and tracks their development to uncover AI's trajectory in library information services. Leveraging deep learning-based topic modeling techniques-BERTopic and Dynamic Topic Modeling (DTM)-we analyzed 2,789 filtered article abstracts retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases published between 2015 and 2024. The modeling process involved several steps: we first generated document embeddings using Sentence-BERT, followed by dimensionality reduction with UMAP to project the high-dimensional vectors into a lower-dimensional space. We then applied HDBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm, to group semantically similar documents. Topic representations were constructed using class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) to identify the most representative keywords for each cluster. Finally, we employed DTM to examine the temporal evolution of these topics over the 2015-2024 period. The study identified 27 topics, including OCR for historical documents, multilingual processing, book recommendation systems, author name disambiguation, and misinformation detection, among others. These were further categorized into ten research directions, such as digital transformation, information retrieval, and scholarly communication. Temporal analysis revealed emerging AI-driven trends alongside steady growth in traditional areas like information literacy education. Findings highlight the growing integration of AI technologies into library information services. This study offers strategic insights for researchers and practitioners to innovate library information services and responsibly adopt AI technologies.
158;Evaluation and modeling of students' persistence and wheel-spinning propensities in formative assessments;"Persistence represents a crucial trait in learning. A lack of persistence prevents learners from fully mastering their current skills and makes it difficult for them to acquire new skills. It further hinders the administration of effective interventions by learning systems. Although most studies have focused on identifying non-persistence and unproductive persistence behaviors, few have attempted to model students' persistence propensity in learning. In the present study, we evaluated students' persistence propensity in formative assessments by using an item response theory model with their attempt data. In addition, we modeled their wheel-spinning propensity. The students (N = 115) of first-level mathematics classes at a high school in Japan underwent the aforementioned formative assessments; their log data were collected. Persistence propensity was found to be correlated with frequency-related statistics, and wheel-spinning propensity was correlated with correctness-related statistics. However, persistence and wheel-spinning propensities were not correlated. A comparison of the students' scores with various persistence and wheel-spinning propensities revealed that both traits considerably influenced their academic performance. The present study provides insights into the use of attempt data to evaluate various characteristics crucial for learning, which are otherwise difficult to evaluate."
159;Automatic Recommendation System of College English Teaching Videos based on Students' Personalized Demands;With the emergence of computers and networks, the social needs for English competence have presented a diversified and professionalized trend. The current single teaching model can no longer satisfy students' needs. To cater to different demands of students and improve their level of satisfaction with personalized and automatically recommended teaching videos, an automatic recommendation system of college English teaching videos, which consists of interface layer, business logic layer, and data layer, was designed. The quality of recommended teaching videos was ensured through the strict management of English teaching videos within the system. The degree of interest in videos was calculated according to students' browsing history of teaching videos. The content of teaching videos that meet students' personalized demands was established on the basis of the degree of interest. The Naive Bayesian classification method was used to precisely, rapidly, and stably divide the teaching videos into two classes-interest and disinterest-according to the abovementioned information. Results show that the recall ratio and precision ratio of this system reach as high as 95.18\% and 97.2\%, respectively. The system recommendations averagely rank top, the recommendation precision is high, and the recommended video contents are abundant, with an applause rate of 97.79\%. This designed system can establish student-centered college English teaching methods, create a favorable language environment, and better promote the teaching of English among college students.
160;A framework to foster analysis skill for self-directed activities in data-rich environment;Self-direction skill is considered a vital skill for twenty-first-century learners in both the learning context and physical activity context. Analysis skill for self-directed activities requires the students to analyze their own activity data for understanding their status in that activity. It is an important phase that determines whether an appropriate plan can be set or not. This research presents a framework designed to foster students' analysis skill in self-directed activities, which aims (1) to build a technology-enabled learning system allowing students to practice analyzing data from their own daily contexts, (2) to propose an approach to model student's analysis skill acquisition level and process, and (3) to provide automated support and feedback for analysis skill development tasks. The analysis module based on the proposed framework was implemented in the GOAL system which synchronized data from learners' physical and reading activities. A study was conducted with 51 undergraduate students to find reliable indicators for the model to then measure students' analysis skills. By further analyzing students' actual usage of the GOAL system, we found the actual activity levels and their preferences regarding analysis varied for the chosen contexts (learning and physical activity). The different context preference groups were almost equal, highlighting the utility of a system that integrates data from multiple contexts. Such a system can potentially respond to students' individual preferences to execute and acquire self-direction skill.
161;The correlation between parents' education attainment and humanistic literacy of eight-year medical students;Objectives: To explore the content, ways, and methods of family education in cultivating students' humanistic literacy. Methods: We used a cross-sectional study and collected questionnaire data from 616 eight-year clinical medical students of Central South University by a convenience sampling survey. To determine the influence of parents' educational attainment on children's humanistic literacy, the students were mainly divided into two groups including parents' education attainment was college or above (Group B) and parents' education attainment below college (Group A). Nonparametric tests are used to test the differences between the two groups in humanistic spirit, interpersonal communication, humanistic knowledge and ability, and development planning. Results: Group B had better social morality and a sense of social responsibility than group A (P=0.024, P=0.001). Compared to group A, students in group B could better integrate into the new environment, communicate with students from different institutes, and take an active part in activities (P=0.001). In a nutshell, students in group B had more excellent humanistic knowledge and ability and could consult medical literature and write in Chinese or English more proficiently than group A (P=0.0001, P=0.0001). Conclusions: We found that the eight-year medical students whose parents' highest education attainment is college or above almost mastered a higher level of humanistic literacy. It demonstrated family humanistic literacy education is irreplaceable. We recommend systematic efforts to build a reasonable and effective family humanistic literacy education platform and form an educational synergy with school education to make the cultivation of humanistic literacy among students more efficient.

Current trends reveal a strong focus on multimodal MEC and deep learning-based methods combining audio, text, video as well as biosignals, suggesting future potential for MEC in areas like multimodal interaction, intelligent emotional feedback, and real-world applications, including mental health and music creation. Additionally, the study identifies challenges facing MEC applications, such as technical hurdles in multimodal data fusion, cultural variations in emotional perception, and concerns surrounding data privacy and ethics. Based on these findings, future research should further explore integration across diverse data sources, enhance the interpretability and generalizability of emotion recognition models, and innovate methods for cross-cultural emotion computing. This study provides a panoramic perspective for scholars in the MEC field and offers strategic recommendations for future research.
164;Data mining method of English autonomous learning behaviour based on decision tree;Because the traditional data mining methods of English autonomous learning behaviour have the problems of low accuracy and long mining time, a decision tree-based data mining method of English autonomous learning behaviour is proposed. Firstly, the students' learning behaviour data is collected, and then the collected behaviour data is classified by the decision tree method, and the data is divided into different types. Finally, according to the data classification results, the cart decision tree method is used to obtain the optimal split point of the decision tree through tree building and pruning operations, and the optimal binary tree is generated to realise the data mining of English autonomous learning behaviour. The experimental results show that the highest comprehensive coefficient of data mining of the research method in this paper is increased by 0.08 and 0.04 respectively, and the accuracy and efficiency of data mining are improved.
165;Leveraging unlabeled data: Fostering self-regulated learning in online education with semi-supervised recommender systems;Although self-regulated learning (SRL) plays an important role in supporting online learning performance, the lack of student self-regulation skills poses a persistent problem to many educators. Recommender systems have the potential to promote SRL by delivering personalized feedback and tailoring learning strategies to meet individual learners' needs. However, fully-supervised learning recommenders require extensive data, while unsupervised learning lacks expert or teacher guidance. To address these problems, we propose a theory blended semi-supervised learning method to implement a SRL recommender system. Specifically, we developed a fully-supervised machine learning recommender and a semi-supervised machine learning recommender to provide relevant suggestions for enhancing student SRL skills. In the first phase of our study, we investigated whether a semi-supervised algorithm could predict students' SRL more effectively than a fully supervised algorithm. In the second phase, we developed two recommender systems, one based on the semi-supervised algorithm and the other on the fully supervised one, to provide relevant recommendations for enhancing student SRL skills. We conducted an experiment involving two distinct groups of online students who received SRL suggestions from the respective recommenders. Our results showed that the semi-supervised learning recommender significantly enhanced students' SRL compared to the fully-supervised one, with a large effect size (F(1, 81) = 12.879, partial eta 2 = 0.14). This research offers insights for enhancing SRL recommender systems and serves as a practical guide for future studies.
166;Data Augmentation for Sparse Multidimensional Learning Performance Data Using Generative AI;Learning performance data, such as correct or incorrect answers and problem-solving attempts in intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), facilitate the assessment of knowledge mastery and the delivery of effective instructions. However, these data tend to be highly sparse (80\%similar to 90\% missing observations) in most real-world applications. This data sparsity presents challenges to using learner models to effectively predict learners' future performance and explore new hypotheses about learning. This article proposes a systematic framework for augmenting learning performance data to address data sparsity. First, learning performance data can be represented as a 3-D tensor with dimensions corresponding to learners, questions, and attempts, effectively capturing longitudinal knowledge states during learning. Second, a tensor factorization method is used to impute missing values in sparse tensors of collected learner data, thereby grounding the imputation on knowledge tracing (KT) tasks that predict missing performance values based on real observations. Third, data augmentation using generative artificial intelligence models, including generative adversarial network (GAN), specifically vanilla GANs and generative pretrained transformers (GPTs, specifically GPT-4o), generate data tailored to individual clusters of learning performance. We tested this systemic framework on adult literacy datasets from AutoTutor lessons developed for adult reading comprehension. We found that tensor factorization outperformed baseline KT techniques in tracing and predicting learning performance, demonstrating higher fidelity in data imputation, and the vanilla GAN-based augmentation demonstrated greater overall stability across varying sample sizes, whereas GPT-4o-based augmentation exhibited higher variability, with occasional cases showing closer fidelity to the original data distribution. This framework facilitates the effective augmentation of learning performance data, enabling controlled, cost-effective approach for the evaluation and optimization of ITS instructional designs in both online and offline environments prior to deployment, and supporting advanced educational data mining and learning analytics.
167;A Novel Teaching Approach for Mobile Internet-Based Collaborative Knowledge Construction in ``Teaching Management '';With the development of education, teaching, as the basic and central work at school, is conducted most frequently with the largest workload. In simple words, teaching management for the purpose of the management of teaching work is an essential content of school management, as well as a basic activity of school leaders. Therefore, more than just the basis and guarantee for the normal operation of school teaching, teaching management course plays a critical role in teacher growth and education reform, has great significance for schools. However, problems in current teaching management courses, such as lack of teacher-student interaction, single teaching content, and simple teaching methods have hindered students to develop interest in learning, and impede teachers to give full play to their educational personality. In this paper, a new collaborative knowledge construction teaching approach was applied in mobile Internet technology environment, and a blended teaching model of students' online autonomous collaborative learning before class, knowledge internalization in class, and leak filling after class was proposed. At the same time, the personalized recommendation technology based on collaborative filtering algorithm was applied. Firstly, mobile terminal core information was collected from the mobile Internet learning platform for preprocessing, and then the processed data were identified by the collaborative filtering algorithm to recognize the intrusion data, thereby realizing the quick screening and accurate pushing of learning resources. It was found from the teaching practice that this model can effectively enhance students' interest in learning, improve learning effects and independent innovation capabilities.

The experimental results show that the proposed optimisation system has few recommendation errors and high recommendation efficiency, and the minimum recommendation error is only 0.11.
170;The crowd in MOOCs: a study of learning patterns at scale;The increasing availability of learning activity data in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enables us to conduct a large-scale analysis of learners' learning behavior. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 351 million learning activities from 0.8 million unique learners enrolled in over 1.6 thousand courses within two years. Specifically, we mine and identify the learning patterns of the crowd from both temporal and course enrollment perspectives leveraging mutual information theory and sequential pattern mining methods. From the temporal perspective, we find that the time intervals between consecutive learning activities of learners exhibit a mix of power-law and periodic cosine function distribution. By qualifying the relationship between course pairs, we observe that the most frequently co-enrolled courses usually fall in the same category or the same university. We demonstrate these findings can facilitate manifold applications including recommendation tasks on courses. A simple recommendation model utilizing the course enrollment patterns is competitive to the baselines with 200x faster training time.
