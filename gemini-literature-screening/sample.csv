1	Subjective versus objective knowledge of online safety/dangers as predictors of children's perceived online safety and attitudes towards e-safety education in the United Kingdom	Children are spending increasing amounts of time online prompting practitioners and parents to raise concerns about their online safety. However, the impact of children's subjective versus objective knowledge on their perceived online safety and attitudes towards e-safety education remain unclear. Questionnaires were used to assess children's (N = 329, aged 8-11 years) perceived online safety, subjective and objective knowledge of online safety/dangers, and attitudes to e-safety education. While participants generally reported feeling safe online and perceived that they had a good awareness of online dangers and how to avoid them (subjective knowledge), they tended to be poor at articulating for themselves exactly what those dangers were and how they personally could elude them (objective knowledge). This was especially true of boys and younger children. Moreover, only subjective knowledge of online safety/dangers significantly predicted perceived online safety. Together, these findings suggest that some children may think that they know how to stay safe online but lack - or at least be unable to articulate - objective knowledge that could actually keep them safe. Consequently, there is a need to assess children's objective knowledge of online safety/dangers and to provide appropriate education for children who currently lack it.
2	Personalized Learning Recommendation System for E-Learning Platforms	This study presents an empirical investigation of a personalized learning recommendation system implemented in a university e-learning platform. Using collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms, we developed a system that recommends learning materials based on student performance and preferences. The system was tested with 500 students over one semester, showing a 23% improvement in course completion rates and 15% improvement in average grades. Our findings demonstrate that personalized recommendations significantly enhance student engagement and learning outcomes in online education environments.
3	Machine Learning Techniques in Educational Data Mining: A Review	This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of machine learning techniques applied in educational data mining. We systematically analyzed 150 papers published between 2015-2023, focusing on classification, clustering, and prediction algorithms. The review covers various applications including student performance prediction, dropout detection, and learning pattern analysis. We discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches and provide recommendations for future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.
4	Adaptive Content Recommendation for MOOC Platforms	An empirical study examining the implementation of an adaptive content recommendation engine in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform. The system utilizes deep learning algorithms to analyze learner behavior, knowledge gaps, and learning styles to provide personalized course material recommendations. Experimental results from 2,000 learners demonstrate improved course engagement (31% increase) and knowledge retention (18% improvement). The study validates the effectiveness of AI-driven personalization in large-scale online education.
5	Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain Management	This conference paper explores the application of blockchain technology in optimizing supply chain logistics. The study presents a theoretical framework for implementing distributed ledger systems in manufacturing industries. While the research discusses potential benefits in transparency and traceability, it does not include empirical validation or educational applications. The focus is primarily on business process optimization in non-educational contexts.
